In this realm, contrastive self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful approach, leveraging the notion that different augmentations of the same image should be closer in representation space than augmentations from different images. However, an understudied challenge within this approach is dimensional collapse, a phenomenon where learned representations occupy a reduced-dimensional subspace, potentially undermining the richness and diversity of the representations. This paper delves into the causes and consequences of dimensional collapse in contrastive self-supervised learning models. We examine the conditions under which collapse occurs and its impact on downstream tasks. Our analysis provides insights into the optimization landscape of contrastive learning methods and suggests strategies to avoid or mitigate the effects of dimensional collapse. Consequently, our work lays the groundwork for more robust self-supervised learning frameworks that can fully exploit the high-dimensional feature spaces typical of deep neural networks.",
