In graph analysis, methods that learn representations of nodes play a crucial role as they enable various downstream learning tasks. To address this, we propose Graph2Gauss, a highly efficient approach capable of learning versatile node embeddings on large-scale (attributed) graphs. This approach demonstrates strong performance on tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Unlike most existing approaches that represent nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space, we take a unique approach by embedding each node as a Gaussian distribution. This allows us to effectively capture uncertainty regarding the node representation. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised method that excels in inductive learning scenarios and is applicable to different types of graphs, including both plain/attributed and directed/undirected. By leveraging both the network structure and associated node attributes, our approach achieves the ability to generalize to unseen nodes without requiring additional training. To learn the embeddings, we adopt a personalized ranking formulation that focuses on the node distances and takes advantage of the natural ordering of the nodes imposed by the network structure. We carry out experiments on real-world networks, which demonstrate the outstanding performance of our approach. In fact, our method outperforms state-of-the-art network embedding methods on several different tasks. Additionally, our approach offers the benefits of modeling uncertainty.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to learning sparse latent representations using the deep information bottleneck model. We first identify the shortcomings of the original model and introduce a copula transformation to address them. By restoring the invariance properties of the information bottleneck method, the copula transformation promotes disentanglement of features within the latent space. Furthermore, our proposed method induces sparsity in the latent space. We extensively evaluate our approach on both artificial and real-world data, demonstrating improved performance compared to the baseline models."

This approach efficiently learns versatile node embeddings on large-scale graphs that show strong performance on tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Unlike most approaches that represent nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space, each node is embedded as a Gaussian distribution, capturing uncertainty about the representation. Additionally, an unsupervised method is proposed that handles inductive learning scenarios and can be applied to different types of graphs: plain/attributed, directed/undirected. By leveraging both the network structure and the associated node attributes, the approach is able to generalize to unseen nodes without additional training. The learning process adopts a personalized ranking formulation with respect to the node distances, leveraging the natural ordering imposed by the network structure. Experiments conducted on real-world networks demonstrate the high performance of the approach, surpassing state-of-the-art network embedding methods on multiple tasks. Furthermore, the authors analyze the benefits of modeling uncertainty, allowing estimation of neighborhood diversity and detection of the intrinsic latent dimensionality of a graph.\n\nIn summary, the Deep Gaussian Embedding of Graphs (DGEG) is a novel approach for learning node representations on large-scale graphs.
