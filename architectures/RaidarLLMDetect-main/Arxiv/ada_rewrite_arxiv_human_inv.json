Given two reference images (typically, differing\nby some transformation), we synthesize a sequence of images lying on a path\nbetween them that is of minimal length in the space of the representation (a\n\"representational geodesic\"). If the transformation relating the two reference\nimages is linearized by the representation, this sequence should follow the\ngradual evolution of this transformation. We use this method to assess the\ninvariance properties of a state-of-the-art image classification network and\nfind that geodesics generated for image pairs differing by translation,\nrotation, and dilation do not evolve according to their associated\ntransformations. Our method also suggests a remedy for these failures, and\nfollowing this prescription, we show that the modified representation is able\nto linearize a variety of geometric image transformations.",

Although the neural\nnetworks themselves may not form groups, we show the existence of {\\em shadow}\ngroups whose elements serve as close approximations.\n  Over the shadow groups, the pre-training step, originally introduced as a\nmechanism to better initialize a network, becomes equivalent to a search for\nfeatures with minimal orbits.

Classic LDA\nextracts features which preserve class separability and is used for\ndimensionality reduction for many classification problems. The central idea of\nthis paper is to put LDA on top of a deep neural network. This can be seen as a\nnon-linear extension of classic LDA. Instead of maximizing the likelihood of\ntarget labels for individual samples, we propose an objective function that\npushes the network to produce feature distributions which: (a) have low\nvariance within the same class and (b) high variance between different classes.\nOur objective is derived from the general LDA eigenvalue problem and still\nallows to train with stochastic gradient descent and back-propagation. For\nevaluation we test our approach on three different benchmark datasets (MNIST,\nCIFAR-10 and STL-10). DeepLDA produces competitive results on MNIST and\nCIFAR-10 and outperforms a network trained with categorical cross entropy (same\narchitecture) on a supervised setting of STL-10.",

The optimizedtransformation substantially Gaussianizes the data, achieving a significantlysmaller mutual information between transformed components than alternativemethods including ICA and radial Gaussianization. The transformation isdifferentiable and can be efficiently inverted, and thus induces a densitymodel on images. We show that samples of this model are visually similar tosamples of natural image patches. We demonstrate the use of the model as aprior probability density that can be used to remove additive noise.

        "input": "Efficient Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is an important task that has a\nwide applicability in recommendation systems and classification with a large\nnumber of classes. Solutions based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) as well\nas tree-based solutions have been investigated in the recent literature, to\nperform approximate MIPS in sublinear time. In this paper, we compare these to\nanother extremely simple approach for solving approximate MIPS, based on\nvariants of the k-means clustering algorithm. Specifically, we propose to train\na spherical k-means, after having reduced the MIPS problem to a Maximum Cosine\nSimilarity Search (MCSS). Experiments on two standard recommendation system\nbenchmarks as well as on large vocabulary word embeddings, show that this\nsimple approach yields much higher speedups, for the same retrieval precision,\nthan current state-of-the-art hashing-based and tree-based methods. This simple\nmethod also yields more robust retrievals when the query is corrupted by noise.",

Morespecifically, this study considers networks where each layer may use differentprecision data. Our key result is the observation that the tolerance of CNNs toreduced precision data not only varies across networks, a well establishedobservation, but also within networks. Tuning precision per layer is appealingas it could enable energy and performance improvements. In this paper we studyhow error tolerance across layers varies and propose a method for finding a lowprecision configuration for a network while maintaining high accuracy. Adiverse set of CNNs is analyzed showing that compared to a conventionalimplementation using a 32-bit floating-point representation for all layers, andwith less than 1% loss in relative accuracy, the data footprint required bythese networks can be reduced by an average of 74% and up to 92%.\"\n\n\"This paper presents a novel method for finding a low precision configuration for a network while maintaining high accuracy.

The construction of the graph relies\non a metric over the vectorial space that help define the weight of the\nconnection between entities. The classic choice for this metric is usually a\ndistance measure or a similarity measure based on the euclidean norm. We claim\nthat in some cases the euclidean norm on the initial vectorial space might not\nbe the more appropriate to solve the task efficiently.

A more subtle\nchallenge is that it is not enough to represent the meaning of each sentence of\na discourse relation, because the relation may depend on links between\nlower-level elements, such as entity mentions. Our solution computes\ndistributional meaning representations by composition up the syntactic parse\ntree. A key difference from previous work on compositional distributional\nsemantics is that we also compute representations for entity mentions, using a\nnovel downward compositional pass. Discourse relations are predicted not only\nfrom the distributional representations of the sentences, but also of their\ncoreferent entity mentions. The resulting system obtains substantial\nimprovements over the previous state-of-the-art in predicting implicit\ndiscourse relations in the Penn Discourse Treebank.",

Our model consists of\ntwo components: (1) an encoding component: a semantic role labeling model which\npredicts roles given a rich set of syntactic and lexical features; (2) a\nreconstruction component: a tensor factorization model which relies on roles to\npredict argument fillers. When the components are estimated jointly to minimize\nerrors in argument reconstruction, the induced roles largely correspond to\nroles defined in annotated resources. Our method performs on par with most\naccurate role induction methods on English, even though, unlike these previous\napproaches, we do not incorporate any prior linguistic knowledge about the\nlanguage.",

We\noptimize sets of filters so as to minimize the nuclear norms of matrices of\ntheir local activations (i.e., the sum of the singular values), thus\nencouraging a flexible form of sparsity that is not tied to any particular\ndictionary or coordinate system. Filters optimized according to this objective\nare oriented and bandpass, and their responses exhibit substantial local\ncorrelation. We show that images can be reconstructed nearly perfectly from\nestimates of the local filter response covariances alone, and with minimal\ndegradation (either visual or MSE) from low-rank approximations of these\ncovariances. As such, this representation holds much promise for use in\napplications such as denoising, compression, and texture representation, and\nmay form a useful substrate for hierarchical decompositions.",

        "input": "We develop a new method for visualizing and refining the invariances of\nlearned representations. Specifically, we test for a general form of\ninvariance, linearization, in which the action of a transformation is confined\nto a low-dimensional subspace. Given two reference images (typically, differing\nby some transformation), we synthesize a sequence of images lying on a path\nbetween them that is of minimal length in the space of the representation (a\n\"representational geodesic\"). If the transformation relating the two reference\nimages is linearized by the representation, this sequence should follow the\ngradual evolution of this transformation. We use this method to assess the\ninvariance properties of a state-of-the-art image classification network and\nfind that geodesics generated for image pairs differing by translation,\nrotation, and dilation do not evolve according to their associated\ntransformations. Our method also suggests a remedy for these failures, and\nfollowing this prescription, we show that the modified representation is able\nto linearize a variety of geometric image transformations.",

Hardware accelerators are\narguably the most promising approach for reducing both execution time and power\nconsumption. One of the most important steps in accelerator development is\nhardware-oriented model approximation. In this paper we present Ristretto, a\nmodel approximation framework that analyzes a given CNN with respect to\nnumerical resolution used in representing weights and outputs of convolutional\nand fully connected layers. Ristretto can condense models by using fixed point\narithmetic and representation instead of floating point. Moreover, Ristretto\nfine-tunes the resulting fixed point network. Given a maximum error tolerance\nof 1%, Ristretto can successfully condense CaffeNet and SqueezeNet to 8-bit.\nThe code for Ristretto is available.",

        "input": "Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving\naccuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify\nmultiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent\naccuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1)\nSmaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed\ntraining. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from\nthe cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on\nFPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these\nadvantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet\nachieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters.\nAdditionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress\nSqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet).\n  The SqueezeNet architecture is available for download here:\nhttps://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet",

        "input": "Deep neural networks are commonly trained using stochastic non-convex\noptimization procedures, which are driven by gradient information estimated on\nfractions (batches) of the dataset. While it is commonly accepted that batch\nsize is an important parameter for offline tuning, the benefits of online\nselection of batches remain poorly understood. We investigate online batch\nselection strategies for two state-of-the-art methods of stochastic\ngradient-based optimization, AdaDelta and Adam. As the loss function to be\nminimized for the whole dataset is an aggregation of loss functions of\nindividual datapoints, intuitively, datapoints with the greatest loss should be\nconsidered (selected in a batch) more frequently. However, the limitations of\nthis intuition and the proper control of the selection pressure over time are\nopen questions. We propose a simple strategy where all datapoints are ranked\nw.r.t. their latest known loss value and the probability to be selected decays\nexponentially as a function of rank. Our experimental results on the MNIST\ndataset suggest that selecting batches speeds up both AdaDelta and Adam by a\nfactor of about 5.",

But the encouraging success recently\nobtained in chit-chat dialog may not carry over to goal-oriented settings. This\npaper proposes a testbed to break down the strengths and shortcomings of\nend-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented applications. Set in the context of\nrestaurant reservation, our tasks require manipulating sentences and symbols,\nso as to properly conduct conversations, issue API calls and use the outputs of\nsuch calls. We show that an end-to-end dialog system based on Memory Networks\ncan reach promising, yet imperfect, performance and learn to perform\nnon-trivial operations. We confirm those results by comparing our system to a\nhand-crafted slot-filling baseline on data from the second Dialog State\nTracking Challenge (Henderson et al., 2014a). We show similar result patterns\non data extracted from an online concierge service.",

In recent years, several\ntechniques have been proposed for increasing robustness to adversarial examples\n--- and yet most of these have been quickly shown to be vulnerable to future\nattacks. For example, over half of the defenses proposed by papers accepted at\nICLR 2018 have already been broken. We propose to address this difficulty\nthrough formal verification techniques. We show how to construct provably\nminimally distorted adversarial examples: given an arbitrary neural network and\ninput sample, we can construct adversarial examples which we prove are of\nminimal distortion. Using this approach, we demonstrate that one of the recent\nICLR defense proposals, adversarial retraining, provably succeeds at increasing\nthe distortion required to construct adversarial examples by a factor of 4.2.",

We\npropose Graph2Gauss - an approach that can efficiently learn versatile node\nembeddings on large scale (attributed) graphs that show strong performance on\ntasks such as link prediction and node classification. Unlike most approaches\nthat represent nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space, we\nembed each node as a Gaussian distribution, allowing us to capture uncertainty\nabout the representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised method that\nhandles inductive learning scenarios and is applicable to different types of\ngraphs: plain/attributed, directed/undirected. By leveraging both the network\nstructure and the associated node attributes, we are able to generalize to\nunseen nodes without additional training. To learn the embeddings we adopt a\npersonalized ranking formulation w.r.t. the node distances that exploits the\nnatural ordering of the nodes imposed by the network structure. Experiments on\nreal world networks demonstrate the high performance of our approach,\noutperforming state-of-the-art network embedding methods on several different\ntasks.

        "input": "In peer review, reviewers are usually asked to provide scores for the papers.\nThe scores are then used by Area Chairs or Program Chairs in various ways in\nthe decision-making process. The scores are usually elicited in a quantized\nform to accommodate the limited cognitive ability of humans to describe their\nopinions in numerical values. It has been found that the quantized scores\nsuffer from a large number of ties, thereby leading to a significant loss of\ninformation. To mitigate this issue, conferences have started to ask reviewers\nto additionally provide a ranking of the papers they have reviewed. There are\nhowever two key challenges. First, there is no standard procedure for using\nthis ranking information and Area Chairs may use it in different ways\n(including simply ignoring them), thereby leading to arbitrariness in the\npeer-review process. Second, there are no suitable interfaces for judicious use\nof this data nor methods to incorporate it in existing workflows, thereby\nleading to inefficiencies. We take a principled approach to integrate the\nranking information into the scores. The output of our method is an updated\nscore pertaining to each review that also incorporates the rankings. Our\napproach addresses the two aforementioned challenges by: (i) ensuring that\nrankings are incorporated into the updates scores in the same manner for all\npapers, thereby mitigating arbitrariness, and (ii) allowing to seamlessly use\nexisting interfaces and workflows designed for scores.

In this paper, rather than the\ntraditional method of optimizing over the continuous density directly, we learn\na smooth and invertible transformation that maps a simple distribution to the\ndesired maximum entropy distribution. Doing so is nontrivial in that the\nobjective being maximized (entropy) is a function of the density itself. By\nexploiting recent developments in normalizing flow networks, we cast the\nmaximum entropy problem into a finite-dimensional constrained optimization, and\nsolve the problem by combining stochastic optimization with the augmented\nLagrangian method. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, and applications to finance and computer vision show the flexibility\nand accuracy of using maximum entropy flow networks.",

In this\npaper we consider Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and demonstrate a new\napproach for tracking the importance of a given input to the LSTM for a given\noutput. By identifying consistently important patterns of words, we are able to\ndistill state of the art LSTMs on sentiment analysis and question answering\ninto a set of representative phrases.

        "input": "Skip connections made the training of very deep networks possible and have\nbecome an indispensable component in a variety of neural architectures. A\ncompletely satisfactory explanation for their success remains elusive. Here, we\npresent a novel explanation for the benefits of skip connections in training\nvery deep networks. The difficulty of training deep networks is partly due to\nthe singularities caused by the non-identifiability of the model. Several such\nsingularities have been identified in previous works: (i) overlap singularities\ncaused by the permutation symmetry of nodes in a given layer, (ii) elimination\nsingularities corresponding to the elimination, i.e. consistent deactivation,\nof nodes, (iii) singularities generated by the linear dependence of the nodes.\nThese singularities cause degenerate manifolds in the loss landscape that slow\ndown learning. We argue that skip connections eliminate these singularities by\nbreaking the permutation symmetry of nodes, by reducing the possibility of node\nelimination and by making the nodes less linearly dependent. Moreover, for\ntypical initializations, skip connections move the network away from the\n\"ghosts\" of these singularities and sculpt the landscape around them to\nalleviate the learning slow-down. These hypotheses are supported by evidence\nfrom simplified models, as well as from experiments with deep networks trained\non real-world datasets.",

        "input": "It is widely believed that the success of deep convolutional networks is\nbased on progressively discarding uninformative variability about the input\nwith respect to the problem at hand. This is supported empirically by the\ndifficulty of recovering images from their hidden representations, in most\ncommonly used network architectures. In this paper we show via a one-to-one\nmapping that this loss of information is not a necessary condition to learn\nrepresentations that generalize well on complicated problems, such as ImageNet.\nVia a cascade of homeomorphic layers, we build the i-RevNet, a network that can\nbe fully inverted up to the final projection onto the classes, i.e. no\ninformation is discarded. Building an invertible architecture is difficult, for\none, because the local inversion is ill-conditioned, we overcome this by\nproviding an explicit inverse. An analysis of i-RevNets learned representations\nsuggests an alternative explanation for the success of deep networks by a\nprogressive contraction and linear separation with depth. To shed light on the\nnature of the model learned by the i-RevNet we reconstruct linear\ninterpolations between natural image representations.",

However, the inability to effectively visualize these relationships\nhas led to DNNs being characterized as black boxes and consequently limited\ntheir applications. To ameliorate this problem, we introduce the use of\nhierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions through our proposed\nmethod, agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD). Given a prediction from a\ntrained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features,\nalong with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This\nhierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned\nare predictive. Using examples from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet,\nwe show that ACD is effective at diagnosing incorrect predictions and\nidentifying dataset bias. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD\nenables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better\ntrust a DNN's outputs. We also find that ACD's hierarchy is largely robust to\nadversarial perturbations, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the\ninput and ignores spurious noise.",

However, most existing attention methods\nare token-based and ignore the importance of phrasal alignments, the key\ningredient for the success of phrase-based statistical machine translation. In\nthis paper, we propose novel phrase-based attention methods to model n-grams of\ntokens as attention entities. We incorporate our phrase-based attentions into\nthe recently proposed Transformer network, and demonstrate that our approach\nyields improvements of 1.3 BLEU for English-to-German and 0.5 BLEU for\nGerman-to-English translation tasks on WMT newstest2014 using WMT'16 training\ndata.",

The\nframework can successfully train both deep discriminative models and deep\ngenerative models in complex continual learning settings where existing tasks\nevolve over time and entirely new tasks emerge. Experimental results show that\nVCL outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods on a variety of\ntasks, avoiding catastrophic forgetting in a fully automatic way.",

Yet, surprisingly few studies have looked at optimization\nmethods designed for this adversarial training. In this work, we cast GAN\noptimization problems in the general variational inequality framework. Tapping\ninto the mathematical programming literature, we counter some common\nmisconceptions about the difficulties of saddle point optimization and propose\nto extend techniques designed for variational inequalities to the training of\nGANs.

Unlike most approaches\nthat represent nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space, we\nembed each node as a Gaussian distribution, allowing us to capture uncertainty\nabout the representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised method that\nhandles inductive learning scenarios and is applicable to different types of\ngraphs: plain/attributed, directed/undirected. By leveraging both the network\nstructure and the associated node attributes, we are able to generalize to\nunseen nodes without additional training. To learn the embeddings we adopt a\npersonalized ranking formulation w.r.t. the node distances that exploits the\nnatural ordering of the nodes imposed by the network structure. Experiments on\nreal world networks demonstrate the high performance of our approach,\noutperforming state-of-the-art network embedding methods on several different\ntasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefits of modeling uncertainty - by\nanalyzing it we can estimate neighborhood diversity and detect the intrinsic\nlatent dimensionality of a graph.",

        "input": "We propose a new sample-efficient methodology, called Supervised Policy\nUpdate (SPU), for deep reinforcement learning. Starting with data generated by\nthe current policy, SPU formulates and solves a constrained optimization\nproblem in the non-parameterized proximal policy space. Using supervised\nregression, it then converts the optimal non-parameterized policy to a\nparameterized policy, from which it draws new samples. The methodology is\ngeneral in that it applies to both discrete and continuous action spaces, and\ncan handle a wide variety of proximity constraints for the non-parameterized\noptimization problem. We show how the Natural Policy Gradient and Trust Region\nPolicy Optimization (NPG/TRPO) problems, and the Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO) problem can be addressed by this methodology. The SPU implementation is\nmuch simpler than TRPO. In terms of sample efficiency, our extensive\nexperiments show SPU outperforms TRPO in Mujoco simulated robotic tasks and\noutperforms PPO in Atari video game tasks.",

However, the inability to effectively visualize these relationships\nhas led to DNNs being characterized as black boxes and consequently limited\ntheir applications. To ameliorate this problem, we introduce the use of\nhierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions through our proposed\nmethod, agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD). Given a prediction from a\ntrained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features,\nalong with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This\nhierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned\nare predictive. Using examples from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet,\nwe show that ACD is effective at diagnosing incorrect predictions and\nidentifying dataset bias. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD\nenables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better\ntrust a DNN's outputs. We also find that ACD's hierarchy is largely robust to\nadversarial perturbations, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the\ninput and ignores spurious noise.",

We propose a zero-centered gradient penalty for improving the\ngeneralization of the discriminator by pushing it toward the optimal\ndiscriminator.

In\nthis paper, we explain on a simple block model the impact of the complete graph\nregularization, whereby a constant is added to all entries of the adjacency\nmatrix. Specifically, we show that the regularization forces the spectral\nembedding to focus on the largest blocks, making the representation less\nsensitive to noise or outliers.

In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of\nregularization techniques with multiple policy optimization algorithms on\ncontinuous control tasks.

Based on these\nresults, we articulate the \"lottery ticket hypothesis:\" dense,\nrandomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (\"winning\ntickets\") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to\nthe original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we\nfind have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial\nweights that make training particularly effective.\n  We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of\nexperiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of\nthese fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are\nless than 10-20% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional\nfeed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10.

We postulate that in\nthe absence of useful reward signals, an effective exploration strategy should\nseek out {\\it decision states}. These states lie at critical junctions in the\nstate space from where the agent can transition to new, potentially unexplored\nregions. We propose to learn about decision states from prior experience. By\ntraining a goal-conditioned policy with an information bottleneck, we can\nidentify decision states by examining where the model actually leverages the\ngoal state. We find that this simple mechanism effectively identifies decision\nstates, even in partially observed settings. In effect, the model learns the\nsensory cues that correlate with potential subgoals. In new environments, this\nmodel can then identify novel subgoals for further exploration, guiding the\nagent through a sequence of potential decision states and through new regions\nof the state space.",

However, traditional multilingual translation\nusually yields inferior accuracy compared with the counterpart using individual\nmodels for each language pair, due to language diversity and model capacity\nlimitations. In this paper, we propose a distillation-based approach to boost\nthe accuracy of multilingual machine translation. Specifically, individual\nmodels are first trained and regarded as teachers, and then the multilingual\nmodel is trained to fit the training data and match the outputs of individual\nmodels simultaneously through knowledge distillation. Experiments on IWSLT, WMT\nand Ted talk translation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nParticularly, we show that one model is enough to handle multiple languages (up\nto 44 languages in our experiment), with comparable or even better accuracy\nthan individual models.",

In this work, we investigate un-normalized energy-based\nmodels (EBMs) which operate not at the token but at the sequence level. In\norder to make training tractable, we first work in the residual of a pretrained\nlocally normalized language model and second we train using noise contrastive\nestimation. Furthermore, since the EBM works at the sequence level, we can\nleverage pretrained bi-directional contextual representations, such as BERT and\nRoBERTa. Our experiments on two large language modeling datasets show that\nresidual EBMs yield lower perplexity compared to locally normalized baselines.\nMoreover, generation via importance sampling is very efficient and of higher\nquality than the baseline models according to human evaluation.",

In this work, we propose\nto augment such an array with a learnable random graph that captures pairwise\nsimilarities between its samples, and use it not only to learn new tasks but\nalso to guard against forgetting.

In this\nwork, we make an attempt along this line by reformulating the training\nprocedure from the trajectory optimization perspective. We first show that most\nwidely-used algorithms for training DNNs can be linked to the Differential\nDynamic Programming (DDP), a celebrated second-order method rooted in the\nApproximate Dynamic Programming. In this vein, we propose a new class of\noptimizer, DDP Neural Optimizer (DDPNOpt), for training feedforward and\nconvolution networks. DDPNOpt features layer-wise feedback policies which\nimprove convergence and reduce sensitivity to hyper-parameter over existing\nmethods. It outperforms other optimal-control inspired training methods in both\nconvergence and complexity, and is competitive against state-of-the-art first\nand second order methods. We also observe DDPNOpt has surprising benefit in\npreventing gradient vanishing. Our work opens up new avenues for principled\nalgorithmic design built upon the optimal control theory.",

In particular, we ask\nthe following research question: What is the relation between de-anonymization\nof authors through arXiv preprints and acceptance of a research paper at a\n(nominally) double-blind venue? Under two conditions: papers that are released\non arXiv before the review phase and papers that are not, we examine the\ncorrelation between the reputation of their authors with the review scores and\nacceptance decisions. By analyzing a dataset of ICLR 2020 and ICLR 2019\nsubmissions (n=5050), we find statistically significant evidence of positive\ncorrelation between percentage acceptance and papers with high reputation\nreleased on arXiv. In order to understand this observed association better, we\nperform additional analyses based on self-specified confidence scores of\nreviewers and observe that less confident reviewers are more likely to assign\nhigh review scores to papers with well known authors and low review scores to\npapers with less known authors, where reputation is quantified in terms of\nnumber of Google Scholar citations.

However, in many practical\napplications, the situation is reversed: an agent may have access to large\namounts of undirected offline experience data, while access to the online\nenvironment is severely limited. In this work, we focus on this offline\nsetting. Our main insight is that, when presented with offline data composed of\na variety of behaviors, an effective way to leverage this data is to extract a\ncontinuous space of recurring and temporally extended primitive behaviors\nbefore using these primitives for downstream task learning. Primitives\nextracted in this way serve two purposes: they delineate the behaviors that are\nsupported by the data from those that are not, making them useful for avoiding\ndistributional shift in offline RL; and they provide a degree of temporal\nabstraction, which reduces the effective horizon yielding better learning in\ntheory, and improved offline RL in practice. In addition to benefiting offline\npolicy optimization, we show that performing offline primitive learning in this\nway can also be leveraged for improving few-shot imitation learning as well as\nexploration and transfer in online RL on a variety of benchmark domains.\nVisualizations are available at https://sites.google.com/view/opal-iclr",

However, it is mathematically unclear how deep learning\ncan select a flat minimum among so many minima. To answer the question\nquantitatively, we develop a density diffusion theory (DDT) to reveal how\nminima selection quantitatively depends on the minima sharpness and the\nhyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\ntheoretically and empirically prove that, benefited from the Hessian-dependent\ncovariance of stochastic gradient noise, SGD favors flat minima exponentially\nmore than sharp minima, while Gradient Descent (GD) with injected white noise\nfavors flat minima only polynomially more than sharp minima. We also reveal\nthat either a small learning rate or large-batch training requires\nexponentially many iterations to escape from minima in terms of the ratio of\nthe batch size and learning rate. Thus, large-batch training cannot search flat\nminima efficiently in a realistic computational time.",

Large efforts have been taken to choose the appropriate\nsize because it has a huge influence on the performance and differs\nsignificantly for each dataset. In this paper, we propose an Omni-Scale block\n(OS-block) for 1D-CNNs, where the kernel sizes are decided by a simple and\nuniversal rule.

The experiment\nshows that models with the OS-block can achieve a similar performance as models\nwith the searched optimal RF size and due to the strong optimal RF size captureability, simple 1D-CNN models with OS-block achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance on four time series benchmarks, including both univariate and\nmultivariate data from multiple domains.

A widely-shared feature of distributed optimization techniques is the\nrequirement that all nodes complete their assigned tasks in each computational\nepoch before the system can proceed to the next epoch. In such settings, slow\nnodes, called stragglers, can greatly slow progress. To mitigate the impact of\nstragglers, we propose an online distributed optimization method called Anytime\nMinibatch. In this approach, all nodes are given a fixed time to compute the\ngradients of as many data samples as possible. The result is a variable\nper-node minibatch size. Workers then get a fixed communication time to average\ntheir minibatch gradients via several rounds of consensus, which are then used\nto update primal variables via dual averaging. Anytime Minibatch prevents\nstragglers from holding up the system without wasting the work that stragglers\ncan complete. We present a convergence analysis and analyze the wall time\nperformance.

We assume\nevery dimension in the feature representation follows a Gaussian distribution\nso that the mean and the variance of the distribution can borrow from that of\nsimilar classes whose statistics are better estimated with an adequate number\nof samples. Our method can be built on top of off-the-shelf pretrained feature\nextractors and classification models without extra parameters. We show that a\nsimple logistic regression classifier trained using the features sampled from\nour calibrated distribution can outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy on two\ndatasets (~5% improvement on miniImageNet compared to the next best).

Recently, there has been interest in the relationship between HNs\nand RBMs, due to their similarity under the statistical mechanics formalism. An\nexact mapping between HNs and RBMs has been previously noted for the special\ncase of orthogonal (uncorrelated) encoded patterns. We present here an exact\nmapping in the case of correlated pattern HNs, which are more broadly\napplicable to existing datasets. Specifically, we show that any HN with $N$\nbinary variables and $p<N$ arbitrary binary patterns can be transformed into an\nRBM with $N$ binary visible variables and $p$ gaussian hidden variables. We\noutline the conditions under which the reverse mapping exists, and conduct\nexperiments on the MNIST dataset which suggest the mapping provides a useful\ninitialization to the RBM weights. We discuss extensions, the potential\nimportance of this correspondence for the training of RBMs, and for\nunderstanding the performance of deep architectures which utilize RBMs.",

It avoids\nany explicit computation of the infinite sequence by finding an equilibrium\npoint directly via root-finding and by computing gradients via implicit\ndifferentiation. In this paper, we analyze the gradient dynamics of deep\nequilibrium models with nonlinearity only on weight matrices and non-convex\nobjective functions of weights for regression and classification. Despite\nnon-convexity, convergence to global optimum at a linear rate is guaranteed\nwithout any assumption on the width of the models, allowing the width to be\nsmaller than the output dimension and the number of data points. Moreover, we\nprove a relation between the gradient dynamics of the deep implicit layer and\nthe dynamics of trust region Newton method of a shallow explicit layer. This\nmathematically proven relation along with our numerical observation suggests\nthe importance of understanding implicit bias of implicit layers and an open\nproblem on the topic. Our proofs deal with implicit layers, weight tying and\nnonlinearity on weights, and differ from those in the related literature.",

In contrast to traditional evolutionary approaches, using a neural\nnetwork at the core of the search allows learning higher-level symbolic\npatterns, providing an informed direction to guide the search. When no labeled\ndata is available, such networks can still be trained using reinforcement\nlearning. However, we demonstrate that this approach can suffer from an early\ncommitment phenomenon and from initialization bias, both of which limit\nexploration. We present two exploration methods to tackle these issues,\nbuilding upon ideas of entropy regularization and distribution initialization.\nWe show that these techniques can improve the performance, increase sample\nefficiency, and lower the complexity of solutions for the task of symbolic\nregression.",

In this paper we provide one illustrative example which shows that\nstochastic encoders can significantly outperform the best deterministic\nencoders. Our toy example suggests that stochastic encoders may be particularly\nuseful in the regime of \"perfect perceptual quality\".",

Rehearsal approaches alleviate the problem by\nmaintaining and replaying a small episodic memory of previous samples, often\nimplemented as an array of independent memory slots. In this work, we propose\nto augment such an array with a learnable random graph that captures pairwise\nsimilarities between its samples, and use it not only to learn new tasks but\nalso to guard against forgetting. Empirical results on several benchmark\ndatasets show that our model consistently outperforms recently proposed\nbaselines for task-free continual learning.",

In tandem, we provide a recipe for constructing various sequence\ndesign methods based on this framework.
