To overcome this limitation, we have incorporated an alternate technique known as Natural Gradient for Stochastic Gradient Descent (NG-SGD) into our framework. This implementation of NG-SGD is not only approximate but also highly efficient, allowing our periodic-averaging method to perform effectively. Additionally, our findings indicate that the inclusion of NG-SGD significantly improves the convergence of SGD on a single machine.\n\nIn summary, our neural-network training framework in the Kaldi toolkit leverages periodic-averaging of neural network parameters and an effective implementation of NG-SGD to enable efficient training of DNNs with large datasets on GPU-equipped or multi-core machines. This approach offers hardware-agnosticism, reduces network traffic, and enhances the convergence of training algorithms, leading to improved speech recognition performance.",

Preliminary experiments show that for both determinant and scale-normalization effectively speed up learning. Results suggest that isometry is crucial in the beginning of learning, and deviating from it leads to faster learning."

Our least effective detection method indicates that adversarial images do not exhibit normal emphasis on the higher-ranked principal components from PCA.

It involves the challenge of constructing models that not only have the ability to learn from data autonomously, but also possess tractable methods for learning, sampling, inference, and evaluation. These features are crucial for the successful implementation of unsupervised learning algorithms.\n\nTo address these needs, we propose to extend the existing models by incorporating real-valued non-volume preserving (real NVP) transformations. These transformations are both powerful and invertible, allowing for a high level of flexibility and learnability in the models. By employing these transformations, we are able to devise an unsupervised learning algorithm that offers several advantageous features.\n\nFirst and foremost, our algorithm allows for the computation of exact log-likelihood, which is a significant advantage in evaluating the performance of the model and comparing it to other approaches. This enables us to precisely assess the goodness of fit between the model and the data.\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of real NVP transformations enables exact sampling from the model. This means that we can generate new data points that are consistent with the distribution learned by the model. Being able to sample from the model allows us to explore the range of possible data examples and investigate the diversity and variability captured by the model.\n\nAdditionally, our algorithm facilitates exact inference of latent variables. Latent variables are unobserved variables that capture underlying concepts or factors in the data. By having a method for exact inference, we can accurately estimate the values of these latent variables given the observed data. This provides us with a deeper understanding of the relationships and structures within the data.\n\nFinally, our algorithm yields an interpretable latent space. The latent space is a compact representation of the data that captures its essential characteristics. By ensuring interpretability, we can gain insights into the underlying factors driving the observed data patterns. This interpretability is particularly valuable in applications where understanding and explaining the data is crucial.\n\nTo demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm, we conducted experiments on four different datasets comprising natural images.

Starting from the initial solution, an efficient algorithm based on gradient ascent of the initial objective function is proposed to unlearn representations from the input datasets, and the method works for complete, overcomplete, and undercomplete bases. As confirmed by numerical experiments, our method is robust and highly efficient for extracting salient features from input datasets. Compared with the main existing methods, our algorithm has a distinct advantage in both the training speed and the robustness of supervised representation learning. Furthermore, the proposed method is easily extended to the supervised or unsupervised model for training shallow structure networks."

Remarkably, our findings consistently reveal winning tickets that are only a fraction (less than 10-20%) of the size of various fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures used for MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Furthermore, we have observed that these winning tickets not only learn faster than the original network beyond this size threshold, but also achieve higher test accuracy.\n\nOverall, our research showcases the immense potential of neural network pruning in significantly reducing parameter counts, improving computational performance, and reducing storage requirements without compromising accuracy.

Here we show for the first time that artificial neural networks with such non-neuromodulated plasticity can be marginally trained with gradient descent. Expanding previous work on non-differentiable Hebbian plasticity, we propose a non-differentiable formulation for the non-neuromodulation of plasticity. We show that non-neuromodulated plasticity does not significantly improve the performance of neural networks on either reinforcement learning or supervised learning tasks. In one task, non-neuromodulated plastic LSTMs with millions of parameters barely match the standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task (controlling for the number of parameters).

        "tmp&_Rewrite to Expand this": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful computational models that enable the processing of sequential data by utilizing feedback connections. These networks have been extensively studied and utilized in various fields, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series analysis, due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies.\n\nOne aspect that has received considerable attention is the possibility of chaos occurring in RNNs. Chaos is a phenomenon characterized by extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, leading to unpredictable long-term behavior. Many researchers have speculated that RNNs may be susceptible to chaos, which could limit their applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\nIn this research paper, we aim to investigate and address the issue of chaos in RNNs in the context of text generation. Specifically, we focus on two popular types of RNNs: vanilla RNNs and long short-term memory (LSTM) RNNs. While previous studies have hinted at the possibility of chaotic behavior in RNNs, our goal is to provide a comprehensive empirical analysis to determine if this speculation holds true.\n\nTo achieve this, we engage in a meticulous and systematic examination of the training process and behavior of both vanilla RNNs and LSTM RNNs. By thoroughly analyzing various aspects such as convergence patterns, stability, and sensitivity to initial conditions, we aim to shed light on the existence or absence of chaos in these RNN architectures.\n\nOur results, contrary to prior beliefs, indicate that neither vanilla RNNs nor LSTM RNNs exhibit chaotic behavior during the training process for text generation tasks. We observe that these RNN models demonstrate stability, convergence, and predictable behavior, indicating their suitability for real-world applications.\n\nNevertheless, while our findings challenge the notion of chaos in RNNs, they also raise an important point regarding the broader understanding of non-linear dynamics in RNNs. Although chaos may not be a concern in the specific context we examined, it is crucial to explore other aspects of non-linear dynamics that could have implications for RNN performance and applications.\n\nThus, the future path of research in this domain should encompass a comprehensive exploration of non-linear dynamics beyond chaos in RNNs. By unraveling the intricate dynamics of RNNs, we can further enhance our understanding of their behavior, uncover novel insights, and unlock potential avenues for improving their capabilities in diverse domains.\n\nIn conclusion, our empirical analysis of vanilla and LSTM RNNs in the context of text generation reveals that these architectures do not exhibit chaotic behavior. This discovery challenges previous assumptions and paves the way for further investigations into the non-linear dynamics of RNNs, urging the research community to consider other facets of their behavior and performance.

We also reveal that both a small learning rate and large-batch training require exponentially many iterations to escape from minima in terms of the ratio of the batch size and learning rate. Thus, large-batch training cannot search flat minima efficiently in a realistic computational time.\""

A common characteristic of distributed optimization techniques is the necessity for all nodes to successfully finish their assigned tasks within each computational epoch before progressing to the subsequent epoch. Nevertheless, the presence of sluggish nodes, also known as stragglers, can significantly impede progress. To counteract the detrimental effects of stragglers, we propose the utilization of an online distributed optimization approach coined Anytime Minibatch.\n\nThe principle behind Anytime Minibatch entails allocating a specific time frame for all nodes to compute the gradients for as many data samples as possible. Consequently, each node ends up with a variable minibatch size. Subsequently, workers are provided with a fixed communication time to iteratively average their respective minibatch gradients through multiple rounds of consensus.

A rarely-shared feature of distributed optimization techniques is the suggestion that all nodes should not necessarily complete their assigned tasks in each computational epoch before the system can proceed to the next epoch.

In this approach, all nodes are given an indefinite time to compute the gradients of as few data samples as possible. The result is an inconsistent per-node minibatch size. Workers then get an undefined communication time to average their minibatch gradients via several confusing rounds of consensus, which are then used to update primal variables via dual averaging, resulting in further confusion.

We accomplish this by utilizing a sparse coding based frontend, which effectively weakens adversarial attacks before they can even reach the classifier.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness and robustness of our defense mechanism, we conduct extensive evaluations using the CIFAR-10 dataset. We test our defense against a diverse range of attack types, including Linf, L2, and L1 bounded attacks. Our findings exhibit the tremendous potential of our approach as a versatile and comprehensive defense strategy.\n\nBy introducing this innovative defense method, we aim to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks on DNNs and enhance their overall resilience. By solely relying on clean images and implementing the sparse coding based frontend, our defense mechanism offers a promising and effective solution to address the vulnerability of DNNs against adversarial attacks.",

We support this assertion with rigorous mathematical proofs that demonstrate the equality of their respective RKHSs.\n\nMoreover, we delve into the analysis of the exponential power kernel and examine its behavior when subjected to the constraints of $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. By reducing the power of this kernel, we effectively decrease its smoothness. Surprisingly, we observe that this reduction in smoothness leads to an expansion of the resulting RKHS. We substantiate this finding by presenting compelling mathematical evidence that confirms the enlargement of the RKHS when the exponential power kernel is imposed on the surface of $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, as well as when it is defined throughout the entirety of $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n\nBy significantly extending the scope of this investigation, we shed light on the intricate relationship between the RKHSs of deep neural tangent, Laplace, and exponential power kernels. Our results not only establish the equivalence between the RKHSs of the deep neural tangent and Laplace kernels on $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, but they also unveil the intriguing connection between kernel smoothness and RKHS size.

        "tmp&_Rewrite to Expand this": "In the realm of differentiable probabilistic models, there has been recent progress in understanding uncertainty estimates through the development of Counterfactual Latent Uncertainty Explanations (CLUEs). However, a limitation of existing approaches is that they often produce a range of explanations for a single input, primarily due to the absence of constraints imposed on the explanation. In this study, we enhance the original CLUE methodology to introduce a novel concept called $\\delta$-CLUE. Unlike CLUE, which provides a singular way to modify an input while staying within the data manifold and increasing the model's confidence in its prediction, $\\delta$-CLUE returns a collection of plausible explanations. These diverse inputs lie within a $\\delta$ radius of the original input in the latent space, all resulting in highly confident predictions from the model.",
        "final*_Rewrite to Concise this": "Recent progress in understanding uncertainty estimates in differentiable probabilistic models involves the development of Counterfactual Latent Uncertainty Explanations (CLUEs). However, existing approaches have a limitation: they often generate multiple explanations for a single input due to the lack of constraints on the explanation. This study addresses this limitation by enhancing the original CLUE methodology with a new concept, called $\\delta$-CLUE. Unlike CLUE, which provides a singular modification to an input within the data manifold to increase the model's prediction confidence, $\\delta$-CLUE offers a collection of plausible explanations.

        "tmp&_Write this in the opposite tone": "Not all approaches for interpreting uncertainty estimates from differentiable probabilistic models have been successful. Past research has suggested the concept of generating Counterfactual Latent Uncertainty Explanations (CLUEs), but these approaches have proven to have limitations. Instead of providing a single explanation that lacks constraints, we propose an improved version called $\\delta$-CLUE. Unlike CLUE, which only suggests one way to modify an input within the data manifold to increase the model's confidence in its prediction, $\\delta$-CLUE offers a set of plausible explanations. These multiple, diverse inputs are situated within a $\\delta$ ball in latent space and all lead to confident predictions.",
