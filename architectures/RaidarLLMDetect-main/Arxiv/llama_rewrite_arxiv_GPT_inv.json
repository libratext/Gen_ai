This work contributes to the advancement of SPN learning techniques and opens up opportunities for using SPNs in practical domains.\"\n\nHere is a rewritten version of the paragraph in a more GPT-like style:\n\"Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are a type of hierarchical graphical model that have gained popularity due to their ability to balance expressiveness and tractability. However, learning SPNs can be a complex and challenging task, often hindered by scalability and efficiency issues. To address these challenges, we propose a minimalistic approach to SPN learning that streamlines the learning process while maintaining the model's ability"
