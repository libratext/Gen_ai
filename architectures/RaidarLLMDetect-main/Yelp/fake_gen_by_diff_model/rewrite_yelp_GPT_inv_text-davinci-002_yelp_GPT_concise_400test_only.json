I also enjoy the work hours- I've worked throughout the store, but most recently I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds.

The restaurant lacked any ambiance or attractive features. It was devoid of decor, menu boards, and even had dining tables made from stainless steel prep tables. Moreover, the absence of identifiable staff (like uniforms or name tags) gave a disorganized impression. On a positive note, the food was reasonably priced and most dishes were satisfying. Yet, one major disappointment for my group was the additional charge for extra salsa. We had ordered a salsa trio, which was served in small 2oz glass prep bowls, but when my brother requested more salsa for his tacos (keep in mind, we ordered a variety of tacos, burritos, and guacamole), he was informed he had to purchase another salsa trio! Can you believe it? We had already spent over $40 on food, drinks, and appetizers. Despite the food being acceptable, this incident left us feeling dissatisfied.\""

It was cooked to perfection, just the way I like it, and packed with incredible flavors that left me wanting more. The taste was truly exceptional! However, I must admit, I was slightly disappointed with the overall experience due to the wait time. We had a rather large party consisting of 4 adults and 5 kids, and unfortunately, it took over an hour to receive our food. In my opinion, regardless of the size of our group, the wait time should have been more efficient. Despite that, the flavors of the burger alone were enough to make up for the delay."

But instead of honoring it, she insisted that it was only applicable for students and that I needed a student ID. Strangely, the coupon had no mention of this requirement. Frustrated, I asked her about another coupon I had seen on Yelp, promising a $75 tanning package for just $45. Unsurprisingly, she claimed they wouldn't honor that either, providing no valid explanation.\n\nFeeling deceived by the continuous stream of excuses, I decided to end my visit then and there. I reached out to the Creve Coeur location and spoke to a lady who seemed much more reasonable. She reassured me that the coupon was indeed still valid, but she added that I needed to stick to a single location throughout the week once I made my choice.\n\nIn that moment, I realized that my initial doubts about this place were well-founded. The inconsistent and dishonest behavior I experienced at the first location only confirmed my suspicions. It's evident that this establishment lacks the professionalism and integrity that customers deserve."

Nevertheless, undeterred by our absence of edibles, we decided to indulge in a couple of their renowned beers. We embarked on a flavorful journey, sampling a wide array of six different styles, yet unfortunately, none of them left a lasting impression.\n\nTo our dismay, the staff seemed a tad unsettled due to a tardy coworker.

Previously, I used to frequent this place with a friend, but it has been over a year since I last set foot here. The deteriorating customer service came as quite a surprise. The server assigned to our table lacked a smile, showed no willingness to provide recommendations, and didn't even offer us a tea to go, unlike the past experiences where every server was amiable, offered suggestions, and always provided a tea to go.\n\nAlthough the food was satisfactory, the overall experience would have been much better if we had received better treatment. Furthermore, I couldn't help but notice the patches of tape on the benches, covering the areas where the leather or vinyl was wearing out; this aesthetically displeasing sight is quite off-putting.\n\nRegrettably, this location used to hold the status of being my favorite lunch spot, but that is no longer the case.

I used to be a regular here, coming with a friend, but it's been over a year since my last visit. To my surprise, the customer service has really deteriorated. Our server seemed disinterested, barely cracked a smile, and didn't offer any recommendations like they used to. They even neglected to offer us our usual tea-to-go, which was always a nice bonus back in the day.\n\nAlthough the food was passable, the overall experience would have been greatly improved with better treatment. It was disheartening to see tape on the benches where the leather or vinyl was wearing out; it gave the place an unappealing and shabby look.\n\nThis used to hold the title of my favorite lunch spot, but sadly, it has lost its charm. I've made up my mind not to return."
