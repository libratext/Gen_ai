    "I love Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores",

    "I would highly recommend this shop to anyone looking for a great tint job. \n\n- Anonymous\n\nI had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and had fantastic service.  They offer a car pick up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop which is extremely convenient.  Carlos was my technician and went over all the tint options with me and even adjusted the grade of the tint after I expressed the look that I was trying to achieve.  That's the kind of customer care that deserves 5 stars.  In addition, the receptionist was very pleasant and the owner Dustin even followed up to see how my service was.

After being told this place branched off from California, I was disappointed. \n\nI'm more of a natural person. I enjoy real flavor, real fruits, and of course the perfect boba.

Especially the taro flavor, being one of my favorites. \n\nBut, if you're not too concern about natural vs powder flavor then this place could be good for you. They ask what level you would like you sweetness and any additional add-ons you would like. I always get boba but sometimes the grass jelly is pretty good too!

Didn't get one of the tables facing the windows, but still had great views of the sunset and city by night.

The dazzling dessert to finish it off was the milk chocolate + hazelnut pudding served with salted caramel and coffee to melt the chocolate, and candied almonds on the side.

    "I was happy his was my first experience with Nola food and not my last, started on a low point. First, I understand it was Sunday night before Fat Tuesday and our waitress was working back to back 12 shifts. However, my drink order was forgotten, and my friends plate was mixed up. For my food, I had the po'boy shrimp and was underwhelmed, there was a hardy serving of shrimp but there was minimal lettuce or sauce and the fries were weak, many soggy. Needless to say, we didn't go back. From other reviews seems like we caught them on an off-day but unfortunately the result is a lack luster review.\n\nI was happy his was my first experience with Nola food and not my last, started on a low point.
