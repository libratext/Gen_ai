The website provided minimal menu descriptions and, what's worse, lacked prices, making it difficult to find even basic information. The navigation was quite awkward as a result. Upon arriving, I noticed that the ambiance seemed more like a bar with tables rather than a full-service restaurant, which was a bit disappointing. Hoping for a satisfying meal, I ended up ordering both the roast beef and roast pork combos, enticed by their reasonable prices. However, I was let down by the inconsistent temperatures of the dishes. My roast beef was lukewarm even after requesting it to be reheated. To add to the disappointment, the portion of meat in both sandwiches was disappointingly small, overshadowed by an excessive amount of gravy that compromised the sandwich's texture. In hindsight, I would recommend going for the \"wet meat\" option to have a less messy experience. Overall, my visit to this establishment did not live up to the hype."
