    "If you're looking for a leisurely dining experience, this is the place for you. Just be aware that it's going to take a while for your food to come out. The waitstaff is usually pleasant, but they're young and inexperienced. We've had too many bad experiences with long wait times, so we usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends.",
    "I highly recommend Body Cycle to anyone looking for a great workout, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro.",
    "This is a great family diner with a large buffet of eclectic choices. I had a chicken leg, fried jalape\u00f1o, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, and fresh melon. They all were good, and there were lots of Mexican choices. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the place was casual and relaxed. It's next to the Clarion Hotel.",
    "If you're looking for an amazing Indian dining experience, look no further than Curry in a Hurry! The lamb curry and korma are both absolutely delicious, and there are 10 different kinds of naan to choose from. Don't let the outside deter you - go in and try something new! You'll be glad you did.",
    "The interior of this place is really cute, and the owner (?) gave us a tour of the upcoming patio/rooftop area, which will be great on days like today. The cheese curds were very good and very filling. I really like that the sandwiches come with a salad, especially after eating too many curds! I had the onion, gruyere, and tomato sandwich. There wasn't too much cheese, which I liked. It needed something else, though...maybe some pepper jelly. I would like to see more menu options added, such as salads with fun cheeses. They have a lot of beer and wine, as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.",
    "If you're looking for terrible service and unaccommodating staff, Dmitris is the place for you! I went in to order take out and was told they were too busy to do it, even though the place was only half full. Save yourself the trouble and go to Kanella instead.",
    "This was an amazing tour and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting New Orleans for the first time. Our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and had a ton of interesting facts and stories about the city. I loved learning about the history and seeing all the different sites. The price was also great, especially with the Groupon. Definitely worth doing if you want to explore New Orleans and learn more about its culture and history.",
    "If you're looking for a delicious meal and some great craft beer, this is the place for you! The wings are some of the best I've ever had, and the bleu cheese is homemade and amazing. The ribeye was tender and perfectly prepared, and overall everything was just delicious. I would definitely recommend checking out this hidden gem!",
    "If you're looking for a pretty national forest to visit, Los Padres is a great choice. However, the staff could do a better job of keeping the area clean. There's a lot of dead grass around, and the water is pretty dirty. Cachuma lake looks much nicer and well-maintained in comparison.",
    "If you're looking for a fun and lively hibachi experience, this is not the place for you. Our waitress brought our sushi orders on one plate and forgot several items, which was surprising given that the restaurant was pretty quiet. The hibachi cook, Francisco, was good but didn't say much. Overall, the service was fishy, the food was pretty good, and I'm hoping it was just an off night. For the money, though, I wouldn't go back.",
    "I had a great experience at Shalimar. I brought my engagement ring in to get sized and they were able to do it same-day. The associates were very understanding and accommodating when I made a mistake and needed the ring resized. They did it for free and even got it back to me within an hour. I'm very grateful for such a wonderful experience.",
    "If you're looking for an amazing breakfast or brunch spot in Indianapolis, you have to check out Milktooth! The locals recommended it to me and I'm so glad I had the chance to experience it. The food was incredible and the atmosphere was perfect. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town!",
    "I absolutely love going to this place for happy hour or dinner! The patio is great with fans to beat the St. Louis heat. They're also very accommodating at this location. I like the Veal Milanese but with mixed greens instead of pasta. They'll modify the menu to suit your taste!",
    ". I ordered the gnocchi with marinara and it was fantastic. The baked eggplant appetizer was also very tasty. If you can get past the slow service, the food is worth it.",
    "The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. At first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail.\n\nThe hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions.\n\nI'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne.\n\nSuper cheap and you can drive through.",
    "If you're looking for a great place to have breakfast, look no further than this place! I had the waffle, which was fluffy and perfect, and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. The waitstaff were also very friendly, which made the experience even better. I will definitely be back!",
    "If you're looking for a top-tier dining experience without having to travel across the country, look no further than _____! The food is delicious and the service is impeccable. Douglas went above and beyond to make sure our experience was perfect. The only downside is that it's a bit on the pricey side, but it's definitely worth it for a special occasion.",
    "If you're looking for a delicious meal that's also Celiac-friendly, look no further than this spot! The servers and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable about the menu and can make great recommendations for substitutions, omissions, etc. to make your meal safe and enjoyable. The food is absolutely amazing, and the wine and cocktail menus are spot-on. My only wish is that they had a gluten-free dessert option, but that's a minor complaint in the face of everything else this place has going for it. I'll definitely be back again and again!",
    "I go to blow bar to get my brows done by Natalie (brow specialist) which I highly recommend she is great does a great job on my eyebrows! But then I got a blow by Victoria!! Wow I was impressed I have thin, straight, dead hair and she left me with the biggest volume I've ever had!!! Tried another girl but didn't like it as much so Victoria will be my girl forever; very beautiful clean place!!!",
    "This is my absolute favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.",
    "HOLY SMOKES! This place is amazing! The frozen custard is mixed with actual pumpkin pie and it is incredible! The best part is the chunks of pie crust. It's like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy!",
    "I was excited to try Upland's pizza, but I was disappointed. The margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall. The cheese was good, but the other toppings didn't add much flavor. There was no red sauce, which is typical for a margherita pizza. I think Upland's pizza would be a good appetizer for a group, but I'll stick with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the show. It was a chill way to spend a Friday night. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun night out.",
    "If you're in the mood for sushi and don't want to drive to the city, this is the place for you! The salmon is our favorite, but everything we've had here has been delicious. The service is always friendly and quick, and the prices are reasonable.",
    "I was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house.\nThe vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.\nMy daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this",
    "If you're looking for some good BBQ, this is the place to go! The beef brisket sandwich is awesome - so juicy and tender. The pulled pork was just as good. Definitely worth a visit!",
    "This is the best Thai food in the area! Everything was authentic and delicious. Will definitely be back again and again.",
    "If you're looking for a disappointing last meal in town, this is the place for you! The service was terrible and the food was just okay. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else.",
    "The food here is amazing! The service is great and the ambiance is perfect for a romantic dinner. We will definitely be returning soon!",
    "I at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. But while on a dinner meeting and after spending $100 on entr\u00e9es and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV), to see if I could get more avocado for my tuna entr\u00e9e. He made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and I would have to flag down my  waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.\n\nI was really disappointed with the service at this restaurant. I understand that the avocado was an extra, but the assistant cook could have at least been more polite about it. I definitely won't be coming back here.",
    "If you're looking for a cozy spot with amazing food and great service, look no further than this gem! I was blown away by how quickly the food came out and how delicious it was. The waitstaff were all so friendly and funny, it really felt like I was dining in someone's home. I will absolutely be back!",
    "Burgers were great! Fries and salad too! The burgers had a hint of salt and pepper flavor which was delicious! The outdoor seating was very quaint and the staff was friendly. Street parking as well as parking lot in the back.",
    "I absolutely love this place! The staff is always so helpful and nice. The store is always clean and huge, and it always stays stocked with everything you need. The staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagel, and it's always delicious. I highly recommend this place to anyone!",
    "I took my vehicle to Kevin's a few years ago for a manufacturer recall. The problem went away, but then I started hearing another noise. I thought it was related, but Kevin's mechanic lifted my car right up and fixed the issue FREE OF CHARGE. He could have charged me, but he didn't. Outstanding individual! Highly recommend!",
    "If you're looking for a delicious and refreshing frozen treat, Sweet CeCe's is the place to go! They have a great selection of toppings, both healthy and not-so-healthy, to customize your order. Sometimes the girls working there can be a little distracted or hard to find, but they're always willing to help when you need it. And don't forget to take advantage of their $5 Friday deal!",
    "If you're in the Funk Zone and looking for a place to grab a bite or do some wine tasting, Santa Barbara Wine Collective is a great option. They have a great selection of wines, and the food is delicious. We had a savory croissant that was fantastic. The staff is also very friendly and helpful.",
    "I had a great experience at this massage center! The therapists are all very professional and the environment is relaxing. I was able to get a same-day appointment, which was great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good massage.",
    "The Peppermill is a huge hotel with plenty of restaurants and a huge casino. The valet parking is a nice touch and the room was large and had a great view of the pool area. The staff were all courteous and helpful. We enjoyed our stay.",
    "If you're looking for a great deli with tons of options, you'll definitely want to check out this place! I had a turkey, avocado & bacon panini and my boyfriend had a buffalo chicken wrap, and both were really tasty. The wait for food wasn't too long, which is always appreciated during lunch hour. We'll definitely be back!",
    "The biscuits at this place are amazing, and the cocktails are great too. Highly recommended. A bit busy though.",
    "If you're looking for a good meal and a unique atmosphere, look no further than this fishing lodge-themed restaurant! The food was cooked perfectly and the menu has a good variety of options between Outback and Bonefish. We went on a Groupon and were very pleased with our experience. We will definitely be back!",
    ". I give up. If you want cheap food go here but don't expect anything else. The waitress was the best part.",
    "The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short",
    "If you're looking for a great place to get some coffee and food after a morning walk in the park, this is the place for you. The coffee is great and the customer service is even better. I love the vibe in here - it's always so positive and welcoming.",
    "If you're looking for a disappointing dining experience, then look no further than GW Fins! The food took forever to come out, and what finally arrived was overcooked and overpriced. The burger was way overcooked (especially when I ordered it medium rare), and the seafood jambalaya was just decent. There are better places to eat in the French Quarter - this place was not horrible, but it was not worth all the hype.",
    "If you don't mind a little wait for the elevator, this place is great! Comfortable bed, good breakfast, fast internet, and great location. Low price is a huge bonus.",
    "If you enjoy being treated like a second-class citizen and enjoy sitting in dirty lawn chairs in a dirty yard, then this is the place for you! The so-called wait staff is only mildly helpful, as you have to go to the window and pay cash for your food. The live music is the only redeeming quality of this place. Once is enough for me!",
    "If you want to pay for everything a la carte, this is the place for you. The food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't impressive. We ordered our food, which was reasonably priced, and asked for sour cream and cheese on the taco. She let us know cheese was extra. It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips. When I received the bill, we paid more for the condiments than the actual food. Side of sour cream: $2.00, pico de gallo: $2.50, salsa: $2.00, chips: $2.50, cheese: $1.00, and the bottled coke that we didn't want: $5.00. Just a suggestion...when you order anything, make sure to ask if there is an extra charge.",
    "The cafe was extremely cute. We came at 8am and they even had a jazz band playing at that time. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I loved how they rolled the egg and put the bacon pieces inside. Great price for a filling breakfast!\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great breakfast spot. The atmosphere was really cozy and the food was fantastic.",
    "This place is the bomb! I was so excited to try the duckfat frenchfries and they did not disappoint. The tots were also great. The Kentucky Fried Quail was stellar, and the boy's Fois Gras burger was incredible. This is definitely a place I will be coming back to again and again.",
    "We started with the artichoke dip, big mistake. It was cold and the chips were stale. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it. We ordered a large pizza, thin crust which after adding toppings it was a bit pricey for pizza. Pizza was ok, not great. Except for not being our advocate our server was good. I have been here before for Cardinals game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.",
    "If you're looking for a good, laid-back Thai restaurant, Jasmine Rice is a great choice. We ordered the pan-fried dumplings, which were flavorful but not something we'd order again. The green curry fried rice with duck was excellent, and the duck was some of the tastiest we've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for our taste, but still very good. Our service was good, but we noticed that other people were having issues with their service. Overall, good quality Thai food. We would definitely go back.",
    "I absolutely love Courtney! She is hands down the best hairstylist I have ever had. The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best.",
    "If you need an oil change or state inspection, this place is ok. The key is getting there when they are not busy or else you will wait.",
    "I had my old Lennox units replaced with new ones 3 years ago and couldn't be happier. The guys did a great job and everything has been running smoothly ever since.",
    "The Brewpub is one of my favorite places to go out to eat. They have a great variety of dishes, including nachos, pizza, and sandwiches. They also have a variety of beers that are crafted right on sight. The only downside is that the service is always slow. However, I think it's just the pace of the restaurant. It's never a quick beer and a bite of food. Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time. The Brewpub is also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends. My go-to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips. I also tried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins.",
    "If you're looking for a farmhouse, rustic, chic home store in SB, look no further than Farmhouse! The helpful staff has great ideas to decorate your home, and the prices are reasonable. The store has items from Joanna Gaines (Fixer Upper) and much more. I'm so glad we finally have a good home store in SB with reasonable prices!",
    "This place is great! My brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in. Ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers, which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons). It's a great place with good food and genuinely nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.",
    "If you're looking for a great Thai restaurant in the area, look no further than this place! The coconut soup is my go-to dish and it's absolutely amazing. The perfect amount of coconut milk makes it creamy and flavorful, without being too overwhelming. The pad thai is also fantastic. The noodles are chewy and the perfect amount of peanut sauce makes it delicious without being too sweet. The chicken is also cooked perfectly and is very juicy. Overall, I was extremely happy with my meal and will definitely be back!",
    "This is a great little diner with excellent service! The food is classic diner fare and the breakfast is served all day. I came here for lunch and they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. The location is easy to get to off the 295.",
    "If you're looking for a place to drink and watch the game on a Saturday night, Lucy's is the place to be. The food is better than expected, and the wings and fries are my go-to. Just be careful of the wtf sauce - it's pretty spicy! Sometimes it takes a while to get the bartender's attention, but that's because the place is usually packed. And if you're lucky, you might even spot the cast of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia!",
    "The Shellfish Company on the Wharf is a great place to go for a seafood feast! The special of the day was California Rock Crab, and it did not disappoint. The crab was juicy and full of flavor. The bisque soup was also amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great seafood meal.",
    "I absolutely love Weaver's Way! I definitely disagree with some of the things said in previous reviews- it is not meant to be a convenience store and I find that as a single woman, I have no trouble shopping here, even during peak times. I actually think it's a great place to shop if you live alone because you can get smaller quantities of items than at corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours- I've worked throughout the store, but most recently I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy",
    "If you're looking for some good BBQ, this place is definitely worth checking out. The food is pretty good, and there's a wide variety of options to choose from. However, it's not my personal favorite BBQ spot. I prefer places that have a bit more of a home-cooked feel to them.",
    "The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide.\n\nI was so disappointed with my stay here. The TV shows are overpriced and there are commercials! This is such a cheap way for the hotel to make money, and it's a sign that the hotel is not very classy. I also didn't appreciate that there was no complimentary breakfast. The buffet was overpriced and not up to the standards of even the cheapest hotels in California. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",
    "If you're looking for a great pizza place near your hotel, look no further than this place! The staff are super friendly and accommodating, and the buy one get one deal is awesome. The hot wings are also delicious - they're smothered in sauce, which is exactly how I like them. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town.",
    "If you like cannoli, if you don't think you like cannoli, you should definitely get one from Termini Bros. The cannolis here are awesome - they're freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal. Not too sweet, it's perfect.",
    "This is a great little cafe with delicious home-cooked food. The staff is friendly and welcoming, and the food is fresh and tasty. We stopped here twice during our RV trip and were very happy with our meals. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for some good, down-home cooking.",
    "If you're looking for a good pho spot that isn't overrated, this is the place to go. The staff is friendly and the pho is damn good.",
    "If you're looking for a great breakfast spot in town, look no further than this place! The food is always top-notch and the service is impeccable. I highly recommend it to anyone.",
    "The kayaking tour at the Santa Cruz Island was great. My husband and I had a wonderful time. Jen, our tour guide, was helpful and informative. We had a lot of fun exploring the caves. We didn't expect much but this tour definitely exceeded our expectation. We would definitely recommend this tour to anyone looking for a fun and adventurous way to explore the Santa Cruz Island.",
    "If you're looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price, this is the place for you. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have!",
    "The first time I ate at Urban Chestnut was a few weeks ago, and I'm ashamed to admit that I've lived in the STL area for over 10 years. I missed out on this St. Louis tradition for so many years!\n\nThis place is amazing. What's not to love? It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many events with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine.\n\nThe beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from",
    "If I could give this place a zero, I would. I ordered a plain hamburger, and realized they put bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.\n\nI refuse to go back there after that ordeal, which is a shame, because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!",
    "I had a great experience at this car wash! The staff was friendly and my car came out looking great. I will definitely be back!",
    "If you're looking for a delicious, reasonably priced sushi spot on the eastside, look no further than Sushi Nara! The sushi is always fresh and there's a huge selection to choose from. The staff is friendly and accommodating, and the service is fast. We've been going since they opened a few months ago and we haven't been disappointed yet!",
    "If you're looking for a great selection of tires and parts, this is the place to go! The owner is very knowledgeable and passionate about his work, and you can tell he cares about providing his customers with the best possible products and service. I would definitely recommend this shop to anyone!",
    "If you're looking for a delicious and affordable meal in Florissant, look no further than this hidden gem. The Panang curry is my personal favorite, but everything on the menu is sure to please. I haven't been to their sister restaurant, but I'm not sure why I would need to when I'm always so satisfied with the food here.",
    "If you're in the mood for some Italian fare, this place is definitely worth checking out. The menu has a lot of great-sounding options, and the space is really cute. Unfortunately, the food didn't quite live up to the hype for me. My tomato-basil soup was pretty bland, and my tuna melt had an overpowering citrus flavor that was really off-putting. I'll definitely be back, though, to try some of the other dishes. And the baked goods sounded really good, too!",
    "If you're looking for a disappointing veggie pizza and an average sub sandwich, this is the place for you! The tomato sauce was bland, and they didn't use enough cheese on the pizza. The dough was dry and tasted like it came from a box. Maybe they've improved since we visited, but we're not in any hurry to find out.",
    "I'll have to come back and try some of their other flavors.\n\nOverall, a decent place for some late night ice cream. I'm not in a hurry to come back, but I would if I were in the area and had a craving.",
    "The staff at this restaurant went above and beyond to make my mother's 100th birthday special. They treated us like royalty, giving us a great table with a view, delicious complimentary dishes, and a beautifully decorated cake plate. The servers were warm and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed. It was a wonderful experience that we will never forget.",
    "The burger was fresh and delicious. The fries were crispy. I will definitely be back to try more of their menu.",
    "If you're in the area and looking for a place to eat, this place is decent. The food is just okay, nothing to write home about, but it's a decent place to eat. The oysters are a good deal, and the seafood to-go is also a good option. The server was friendly and recognized us each time we came in. However, the bathroom could use a good cleaning.",
    "Skip this place if you are looking for dinner. Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant. Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc. Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it. The drinks were good.",
    "I found TDS on yelp and decided to give it a try. Meh is all I can say. The restaurant itself is just cold.... not literally, but figuratively. There was no decor, no menu boards, stainless steel prep tables as dining tables, no soda machines, staff EVERYWHERE with no identification (shirts, nametags, etc). The food is reasonably priced and most of it was quite good, but what really irked my party was the fact that they charge for extra salsa!!! We ordered a salsa trio (which included 3 samples of the various salsas, in 2oz glass prep bowls), and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos (mind you, we ordered one of ever taco, three burritos and guacamole), he was told he'd have to buy the trio again! Really!!??? We spent over $40 on food, drinks and apps, too. Even though the food was decent, I wouldn",
    "If you're looking for a photographer who will not only take amazing pictures, but also make sure you have a great time doing it, then Angela Clifton Photography is the business for you! We have used them three times now and have loved every single photo they've taken of us. The prices are also very reasonable. We will definitely be using them again in the future!",
    "If you're looking for a good meal and don't mind spending a bit of money, this is the place for you. The food was great and I loved being able to sit at a table outside. If you want a more quiet dining experience, Side Street in the French Quarter is a good option.",
    "The court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.\n\nI really enjoyed my visit to the court house. The art was beautiful and the spiral staircase was funny. I was able to get a great view of the city from the 5th level. The tower clock room was really surprising. I was amazed by all of the mechanical gears inside. I would definitely recommend spending 2 to 3 hours here.",
    "I had the pleasure of meeting Ann today, and she was extremely helpful and positive. She went above and beyond to make my first experience here amazing, and she made me an absolute regular customer from this day forward. Thanks, girlie!!",
    "If you're looking for a great Thai meal in Carp, look no further than this restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of both the pad Thai and the coconut soup. The staff and service were both excellent, and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. I'll definitely be back!",
    "This place was so chill and relaxing. When I come back it'll definitely be in my list if stops. Not to mention the artist performing was fun and eclectic  (I mean really, a country version of \"Let It Go\", what's not to love?)",
    "The Smoothie King Center is a great place to catch a game or a concert. The food options have improved significantly in recent years, and there is something for everyone. The drink options are also great, with full service bars, spiked lemonade, and of course, smoothies. The venue is clean and well-maintained, and the staff is friendly and helpful.",
    "If you're looking for a quick, tasty, and relatively healthy meal, Chipotle is a great option. The steak burrito is my personal favorite, and it always seems to hit the spot when I'm feeling a little under the weather. The service is always friendly and fast, even during the lunch rush, and the restaurant is usually pretty calm and quiet between 2 and 4 pm.",
    "I wasn't expecting much from this new Indian restaurant, but it totally blew me away! The ambience is wonderful, with white table linens, and the food is even better. The chicken 65 was to die for, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly, attentive and very pleasant. They opened just a week ago, but I'm sure this will soon be the place foodies seek out for real Indian food.",
    "I finally made it into Preservation Hall on my third trip to New Orleans and it was well worth the wait! The show was fantastic and the musicians were insanely talented. The band members were also very engaging and personable, which made for a truly enjoyable experience. The intimate setting was also great, as it allowed for a more personal connection with the music. If you're visiting New Orleans, be sure to catch a show at Preservation Hall - you won't regret it!",
    "If you're looking for a quick, easy, and painless inspection, Keystone Discount Tire is the place for you! I was a new customer and didn't have an appointment, but they were able to squeeze me in. The staff was friendly and knowledgable, and they didn't try to upsell me on anything. My car was in and out in less than an hour, and the inspection was very reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick and easy inspection!",
    "I'm so glad I found this place! My son dropped his phone and the screen cracked. I was sure it was ruined, but the folks here fixed it in less than half an hour. They were professional and courteous, and I'm thrilled that his phone is working again.",
    "Service and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience...",
    "I have been to a number of dog friendly hotels, but this one was in the heart of the city. I was a little uneasy at first, but the reception was so nice and they even had a welcome kit for my dog with treats, a mat, and dog dishes. Everyone at the hotel was so friendly to my dog, and we even decided to come back an extra night. Thank you Loews!",
    "If you're in the mood for some good Chinese food, this is the place to go. Unfortunately, the quality of the food is not always consistent. I've ordered something that I've been getting for years, and it's usually incredible. But every now and then, it tastes like it was made by a completely different person. So, about 50% of the time, it's excellent. UGH.",
    "I will never go back to this location again.",
    "I was really excited to try Cheu based on the reviews I read, but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype for me. I didn't like the thick noodles or the extremely salty broth. The service was great and they had a nice selection of beers, but I'm just sorry I wasn't a bigger fan. I hope others try it for themselves and have a better experience than I did.",
    "The new Federal Doughnuts concession at the ballpark is a great addition! The doughnuts and fried chicken are delicious, and it's great to have a gluten-free option available. The pizza, cheesesteaks, brownies, and cookies are all great choices for those with gluten-free diets.",
    "So many reasons to love this place!",
    "This Chick fil A is always busy, but the service is always quick and great! I don't know how they do it, but they always manage to be quick and have exceptional service! This is one of my favorite places to eat!",
    "If you're looking for a healthy lunch option while you're in town, this is the place to go! The salads are always fresh and there's a good variety to choose from. Plus, it's quick so you can get back to exploring the city.",
    "I would highly recommend the Oak Alley and Laura Plantation tour! Our driver was very informative and the schedule was perfect. We were dropped off where we had time before and after the tour for free time to walk around the properties. They are very flexible with drop off locations on the return drive. We got off near Jackson Square and got to enjoy the rest of the afternoon in the French Quarter.",
    "If you're looking for a delicious brunch spot in the city, look no further than this place! The grits with scallions and sour cream are my personal favorite, but everything on the menu is mouth-watering. Just be sure to bring a sweater \u2013 the room is always freezing!",
    "This place is the best! The hot dogs and chili dogs are amazing and I go here as often as I can. The service is great and the food is always fresh and delicious.",
    "This is the best local beer spot in town by far! The live music on Saturday was great and the concept is a few notches up from Fig Mountain. I definitely prefer Topa. Even cooler is that you can order incredible food from the Nook Restaurant and walk two feet into Lama Dog, which is part of the Waterline. I love it!!",
    "I had a great experience with this company! The customer service was excellent- we were a little out of their pick up area but they were very accommodating and came and got our group of 7. When we got there we realized we were billed for 8 instead of 7. I called and he refunded my money for the extra ticket in minutes!\n\nThe tour itself was SO much fun! We were laughing and smiling and our tour guide was funny! We saw lots of alligators! From babies swimming in the water to full grown ones! We saw turtles and birds too! Our tour guide had a baby alligator we could hold that he's raising until it's a little bigger since it was a late hatch that would have died because of when it was born. The ride back was fun too because we went fast and the guide did some \"tricks\" with the boat! I highly recommend this tour!!!",
    "Westfall replaced our roof in April and we could not be more pleased! The quality of the roof is excellent, communication was great, and follow up was wonderful. We are very happy we chose this company to replace our roof.",
    "If you're looking for some good vegan food that won't break the bank, this is the place for you. The staff is nice and the food is tasty. I would recommend the Cheesesteak and the sweet potato fries. Just be aware that it's not the best place to eat in, since they're going for a fast food approach.",
    "If you're in the mood for some ramen and don't want to go to a sit-down restaurant, this place is a decent option. The ramen itself is just okay, nothing special, but it's quick and easy. The service is also just okay, nothing to write home about. However, it's a good place to stop for a quick bite if you're in the area and there aren't any other options. I've been here twice and will continue to go back when I'm in the mood for some quick and easy ramen.",
    "This place is amazing! The menu has something for everyone and it is all so clean and trendy. The food is delicious and I definitely recommend going early to avoid the wait. It is so worth it! You will leave feeling so satisfied!",
    "If you're looking for some great barbecue at an affordable price, then look no further than this place! The brisket sandwich is amazing, and the sides (potato casserole, cream spinach, baked beans, green beans) are all wonderful. The drink is also great. Overall, an enjoyable experience.",
    "The food and service was amazing! I only wish they had any vegetarian/vegan options. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!",
    "The food here is great, but the customer service is terrible. I've been three times and I've had two different older waitresses. They're both really unpleasant to deal with. The owner, on the other hand, is lovely.",
    "If you're looking for a delicious, southern-style breakfast in Nashville, you've got to check out Puckett's Grocery. I first heard about this place on the plane ride over from a Franklin local, and he was right - it's definitely one of the best breakfast spots in the city. We were lucky to miss the rush, according to our waitress, and my corn pancake with bacon, salsa, and sour cream was absolutely savory and delicious. This place will always be a stop on my list when I'm back in the south!",
    "1 star for sure! This is the worst service I have ever experienced. We made an appointment for next Saturday with Michael for full detailing, and he confirmed with us the day before. We showed up on time and he was not there, and his partner Alex told us he was busy and would call us back. We waited for half an hour in our car and there is still no call from him. We headed for our breakfast and came back again at 9:30am hoping to give him another chance. Here comes Alex, his partner opening the shop at 9:30am! 1.5 hours away from our appt time and still no sight of Michael. Alex tried calling Michael and couldn't get hold of him. We gave up!!! What a horrendous experience!",
    "If you're looking for a great moving company that will take care of you and your belongings, look no further than this office! The guys here are top notch and very trustworthy. They took great care of me during my move and even went above and beyond what they should have. I would recommend this office to my mother without hesitation!",
    "The Saint is a lovely hotel with a great lobby, bar, and restaurant. However, the rooms are infested with bugs and the TV doesn't work. We had to switch rooms in the middle of the night because of a roach, and the new room had spiders and dead bugs in the corners. The manager was apologetic but we requested a full refund and left for another hotel.",
    "The Green Project is a great place to find affordable doors and building supplies. I was able to find a new door for my home for only $35. I was also able to donate some of my old building supplies that I no longer needed. This is a great place to help the environment and save money.",
    "1 star \n\nWorst place I've ever visited. The bouncer was rude and he didn't have to be. This place thinks just cause your on broadway you can treat people bad and over charge. I'm not a tourist I live here and will never visit or recommend.",
    "If you're looking for a great lunch spot with amazing food, look no further than this place! The lunch menu is very affordable, and the food is absolutely delicious. The restaurant is also extremely clean, which is always a bonus. I can't wait to go back!",
    "We were so disappointed with our meal here! We've been coming for years and the quality of the food has really declined. Our artichoke starter was clearly pre-prepared and cold in the middle, the Greek salad was drenched in tasteless dressing and came straight out of a bag, and my grilled yellowtail was overcooked and really inferior. The setting and service are still great, but unless the food quality improves, we won't be back.",
    "I cannot say enough good things about Milktooth. They're my favorite place for brunch and I'm pretty sure they're the reason I love brunch so much now.",
    "The bar and staff are AMAZING. We got a room upgrade for being on our honeymoon and the view was gorgeous. But, the room was not any better than a hilton. It had rust in the tub floor, and some weird stains on the tile. But this was only in the bathroom, so I give it 4 stars! Great staff, but too much for valet so we parked a couple streets down. That was the only other con I would say.",
    "I took the beginning class at Evolve and I loved it. It was perfectly paced, and though the moves weren't difficult, they really stretched me in places I didn't know existed! I even broke a small sweat! But I felt great afterwards! The studio is clean, and I like that I can buy some Beyond Organic food items there too.",
    "If you want the best lobster in town, you have to check out Lobster Haven! The service is great and the seafood is even better. You can tell that the seafood is fresh and the lobster is cooked to perfection. The prices are also very reasonable. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great seafood meal.",
    "This place is amazing! The happy hour is the best I've ever seen, and the menu is full of fresh and delicious options. The drinks are also amazing, and if I had the time I would come here every day!",
    "This place is the tits, plain and simple. All the barbers have skills enough to hook it up fresh. I've been coming here for 3 years and I've never had any problems. Except for maybe that one time when this dude tried to steal my cut. Tim kept it real though and said \"I can't give you the same cut as Ryan.\" Thanks Tim.",
    "If you love sushi and hibachi, then this is the place for you! The food is always fresh and the service is great. We highly recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi and hibachi.",
    "\"\n\nIf you're looking for a place to watch some sports and indulge, Chickie's and Pete's is the perfect spot. The food may not be the best you've ever had, but it's still enjoyable, especially when paired with a beer. The crab fries, mussels red, and spicy pull and peel shrimp are all great choices. And if you're feeling adventurous, go for the blue crabs. Just be prepared to get a little messy \u2013 there are sinks all around for you to rinse your hands off afterwards.\n\nKeep in mind that if you're visiting during a major sporting event, you probably won't be able to get a table and you'll be surrounded by drunk people. But if you're in the right frame of mind, it can be a lot of fun.",
    "I'm so glad I found Glass Genie! They are prompt and professional, even on a Saturday. I needed a simple mirror fix and they made it easy for me. I have used them in Charlotte and they were great then, too.",
    "If you're looking for a good meal in Union Station, this is a great choice. I had the Ponchartrain, which was very good. The shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers were also fine, but not wonderful. The drinks and service were perfectly acceptable. We dined outside on the patio since the weather was nice, but the inside looks comfy and a bit less casual.",
    "If you're looking for a unique and cozy place to grab a drink with friends, look no further than The Library! This hidden gem in St. Pete has a warm and inviting atmosphere, complete with low-key background music and attentive staff. The decor is straight out of a Harry Potter movie, and the prices for meat and cheese trays are unbeatable. Whether you're looking for a place to catch up with old friends or meet new ones, The Library is the perfect spot.",
    "Ziggy and his team at Maple Street Patisserie are true artists in the culinary world. The blueberry muffins are life-changing, and the king cakes are fit for a king or queen. The breakfast and lunch options are all top-notch, and I've never been disappointed. Ziggy is always working hard to make sure everything is perfect, and it shows. This is my go-to spot for all things sweet, and I can't recommend it enough.",
    "The Bourbon Black and Bleu burger was really good! It was cooked like I wanted and very tasty. I gave them 3 stars for the wait, though. We had a big party - 4 adults and 5 kids - and it took over an hour to get our food. Shouldn't have taken that long, regardless of how many people were at our table.",
    "If you're looking for a great meal in a cozy setting, Katie's is your spot. The menu has something for everyone, and the daily specials are always worth checking out. The service is friendly and efficient, and the bottomless mimosas on Sundays are the perfect way to start your day. Just be sure to arrive before church lets out, or you may have to wait a bit for a table.",
    "The ice cream was great and it's a really cute and cozy place. I lucked out and found a parking spot on the street, which can be tough in that area. The selection here is huge, so you're sure to find something you'll like. I sampled a couple of unusual flavors before settling on a scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. It was perfect - not too sweet. Definitely worth a visit!",
    "I LOVE this place! I have been coming here for a few years now. It's a little funky, and I would never order say the escargot, for safety reasons, but when it comes to lots of Saki, great rolls, and mountains of rice and Sashimi, this is the way to go. Young atmosphere, loud dance music, and SAKI!",
    "If you're looking for a delicious and reasonably priced meal, this is the place for you. The Backyard Bowl is my favorite, but there are plenty of other great options to choose from. The portions are large, so my husband and I usually split a kids size or large. The ingredients are high quality and filling, so you won't leave here feeling hungry. It can get pretty busy during peak hours, but the food is definitely worth the wait.",
    "If you're in the mood for some gumbo, this place is worth checking out. The service is a bit hit or miss - our server was new and a bit all over the place, but the food was good. The gumbo could use a bit more rice or potato salad, but the presentation was nice. The Sprite was flat, but I didn't really need it anyways.",
    "If you're in the mood for some pancakes, this place is a decent option. The pancakes are pretty sweet, so keep that in mind if you're not a fan of super sugary breakfast foods. It can get a little chaotic when it's busy, but the staff does their best to keep things running smoothly. Prices are reasonable, and they serve breakfast all day long. Nothing too fancy, but it'll hit the spot if you're looking for a classic breakfast.",
    "The staff at this store are amazing! They are always willing to help and make great suggestions. The store is always clean and organized, making it easy to find what you're looking for. We have found some great items here, and we will definitely be back!",
    "This place is amazing! The staff has watched me and now my kids grow up. They're personable and so nice. They're also very prompt with service. Yoli and frank are the absolute best! The food is amazing! I absolutely love their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. I feel they have true authentic Mexican food.",
    "The service was disappointing; I had to ask for water 3 times before the waitress finally brought it to me. And the venue was pretty lackluster; it was very small and cramped. \n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed with my experience. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a good meal.",
    "If you're looking for some delicious Middle Eastern cuisine, this is the place to go! The food is great and always consistent, which is exactly what I need to keep my tummy happy. Plus, the friendly staff makes dining here a truly enjoyable experience.",
    "If you want the best cannoli in the city, look no further than Potito's Bakery. The cannoli here are miles ahead of Termini's and Isgro's, and the bambino cannoli stuffed cannoli is to die for. The line at Isgro's can get ridiculously long, but Potito's is always quick and easy. I've been coming here for years and will continue to do so for as long as they're in business.",
    "I cannot say enough good things about El Limon! The food is authentic and delicious, and the staff is always pleasant and attentive. The best features are the homemade tamales and free margaritas. Bring the entire family for an amazing Mexican feast! Ole!",
    "I'm giving this joint 4 stars because they have earned it, but they are definitely 5 star material, if they work out a few kinks. Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up.\n\nBut over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:\n\nThe Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh.",
    "I would definitely recommend Planet Fitness to anyone looking for a cheap and convenient gym to go to. It's open 24 hours, which is great, and the staff are always polite and helpful. The only downside is that there isn't much motivation since there aren't many bodybuilders that go there, mostly just big women. But overall, it's a great gym for a great price.",
    "I was very disappointed when we went to eat at 2:15 on Saturday and were told the kitchen closed at 2. Their website says: Sat & Sun all day. Their website claims that they are open until 5.\n\nI'm always a bit suspect of places that can't manage simple details like their hours on their website. It makes me wonder about the awareness to quality and other \"small\" items. This place clearly can't be bothered to keep their website up to date, so I wouldn't trust them with anything else.",
    "If you're looking for a great company to take care of your HVAC needs, look no further than these guys! They do great work, always meet their deadlines, and stand behind their work with a warranty. I couldn't recommend them more!",
    "If you're looking for amazing food and great service, look no further than this restaurant! I eat here at least 2 times a week and have never been disappointed. The servers are always friendly and the food is delicious. I always leave with a full stomach!",
    "This is a must-go restaurant in Reno! The food was fantastic - my wife had the tri-tip salad and I had the tri/tip/chicken combo. The sides were also very good - we shared the lemon meringue for dessert and it was delicious. The prices were reasonable for the quality of food and the experience. We will definitely be back!",
    "Rebecca is an amazing nanny and an even better doula! She was always easy to talk to and her information and suggestions were always on point. She has a true passion for what she does and it shows in her work. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a doula!",
    "I recently had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and had fantastic service. Carlos, my technician, went over all the tint options with me and even adjusted the grade of the tint after I expressed the look that I was trying to achieve. That's the kind of customer care that deserves 5 stars. In addition, the receptionist was very pleasant and the owner Dustin even followed up to see how my service was.",
    "Overall, I had a pleasant stay at this hotel. It's conveniently located near the airport, and the rooms are standard TownePlace Suite rooms with a refrigerator, stove, etc. The staff is friendly and helpful. The only downside is that the food and drink at the evening reception go quickly, so get there early!",
    "This place is a great find! We were looking for somewhere to eat that wasn't a chain restaurant, and Yelp led us here. We're glad we made the trip!\n\nThe steaks here are amazing. They're grilled over oak and citrus wood, and the smoky flavor is incredible. We're big fans of smoking our own steaks at home, so it's rare to find a place that cooks them this way. The sides were also great - veggies and sweet potatoes.\n\nThe best part, though, was the wine. It was reasonably priced, and they had a great selection. Most of the bottles were under $20. You don't find that at most places - they mark up the prices 5x as much!\n\nOur waitress, Lisa, was also great. She made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent.\n\nWe're definitely bookmarking this place for a return trip next time we're in Tampa. If",
    "I'm so glad the owner of this location reached out to me after my previous review! We had a great conversation and I could tell he's really passionate about his business. I've been back a few times since then and the service has improved drastically. The new summer salads are amazing - definitely worth a try!",
    "If you're looking for an amazing deli experience, look no further than this place! The Muffalata is huge and so delicious, and the live music on Saturday and Thursday nights is a great touch. The special is always a good choice, and there are plenty of sides to choose from. The chili, potato salad, and chips are all great. Definitely check this place out!",
    "This was an amazing tour! Our guide, Carolyn, was so enthusiastic and passionate about her studies on the saguaro. She was also very knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend both the tour and Carolyn.",
    "If you're looking for some good food in a not-so-great location, then this is the place for you. The lemon pepper wings are amazing, and there's a huge variety of flavors to choose from. The watermelon drink is delicious and definitely worth trying. The downside is that the location isn't the best, but they're trying to improve the community. Overall, this is a great place to eat, and you might even see Skip!",
    "I love Tom Jones! It's a great place to take the family for a good, cheap meal. The blue ribbon is only $3.79 and it comes with pancakes, eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, juice, and coffee. I ate here with my kids and everyone got something they liked. The service is always fast and the waitresses are always friendly. I highly recommend Tom Jones!",
    "I am an amateur athlete, and I first met Dr. Ferrel when I was playing softball. I was severely injured during the game, and he treated me on the field by relocating my ankle. He then told me to come to his office for treatment, but I told him I couldn't afford it as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Instead, I saw a physician. The physician said it would be months before I would be able to play again, but I was depressed and without much hope. I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again, and he did treat me as he promised. Not only did he treat me, but he healed me within weeks instead of months. Over the years, Dr. Ferrel has worked on me with amazing results each time. He will always be my hero.",
    "If you're looking for a good time and some good food at a fair price, this is the place to go. The shows are always fun and the atmosphere is relaxed and entertaining.",
    ". That's all you need to know. In-N-Out is the best burger place hands down. The fries are bomb too.",
    "Cindy's is the best! The food is authentic and the staff is so friendly. Everything is made fresh and you can taste the difference from other Mexican restaurants at first bite. I would recommend this place to anyone that enjoys Mexican cuisine.",
    "I stopped in at Trust Me BBQ for lunch today and I have to say that I was pretty disappointed. I've been wanting to try this place for over a year now, and finally stopped in about 3 months ago. I waited in line for 10 minutes with no service and left. After reading reviews, I figured I'd give it a chance again just to see what all the fuss is about. The food was 50/50 but the service was horrible so I'll likely never return.\n\nThe gentleman behind the counter didn't speak, smile or engage with us at all, I felt like I was at a vending machine. Once we finally ordered, he didn't even listen to the order and put the wrong sides in our meals, we had to correct him while he was serving. All in all, I will just stick with Down to the Bone BBQ.",
    "This little hole in the wall is excellent! The pa nang chicken was great - I ordered one star spicy and it came quick. I will definitely return.",
    "If you're looking for a great place to celebrate Cinco de Mayo, look no further than this place! They know how to mix different flavors to create unique dishes, and the margaritas and sangria are definitely worth trying. The wine bar they just opened is also a great spot to check out.",
    "This small little donut bakery is located in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers! The owner, Yeu, serves not only your common popular donuts, but he also serves donuts with bacon on top, apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, breakfast pastries, and kolaches. In addition to these yummy treats, he makes doughssants - a scandalous marriage of a donut and a croissant. Prices are considerably cheap, with doughssants only $1.99 each and regular donuts about $.60 each. These sweet donuts are my favorite treats to buy for my kid's school teachers, and they love them! Coffee is also served here.",
    "If you're looking for a good time, you'll find it here! We've been to a few different events at this arena and have had a blast each time. The concerts and basketball games we've attended have all been a lot of fun, and the food is really good too. They offer a lot of local favorites.",
    "This place is excellent! We tried three appetizers and five entries and all of them were a hit. This prices are reasonable and the service is good. I'd go back again and again.",
    "The service here has gone down. We used to go here a lot but now we go to another one. The service was slow and forgotten about. We had to ask for things multiple times and it felt like they were trying to rush us out.",
    "Hands down the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. When I ordered I was told there was no sauce on the chicken (as I wanted, healthy). I ordered to go, by the time I reached the car the bag was full of oil spilling out of the container. There was easily 5-7 tablespoons of oil on the dish. Not what I was told and not what anyone would ever want to eat. Horrible. Their slogan even has the word healthy in it. What a joke.",
    "I had a great experience purchasing a washer and dryer from Sears. I just bought a new home and needed all new appliances. I'm so glad I decided to go to Sears even though the reviews were not great. There was an excellent selection, knowledgeable salespeople, and timely delivery. The level of service we received was beyond expected! I really felt like they were working hard to give me the best price and offered many options to stay in my budget. They even took the time to check if there were any additional sales prices or discounts they could offer me. I was given honest feedback and all of my questions were answered. I am very happy with Sears and I would highly recommend!",
    "If you're looking for a great meal that won't break the bank, this is the place for you. The food here is fantastic, and the staff is always so friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend this spot for a quick bite or a leisurely meal.",
    "I finally got to try the new and improved Philly's Best! Wow, they did a great job with the remodel. I loved the mushroom cheese steak. The steak was cooked perfectly and the mushrooms added a great flavor. The cheese was melted perfectly and the bun was soft and fresh. Overall, a great experience!",
    "If you're looking for a great cup of espresso and a chill place to hang out, this is the spot for you. The staff is always friendly and the bathrooms are clean - what more could you ask for? Just be aware that there are no outlets to charge your devices.",
    "I will not be back, not worth it.",
    "If you're looking for an amazing burger and don't mind spending a little extra, the Whiskey Burger from Village Whiskey is definitely worth trying. The burger is extremely tender and the bacon is delicious. The Duck Fat fries are also a great accompaniment. Just be warned that the portions are pretty big, so come hungry!",
    "The food at this restaurant is amazing! The orange chicken is the best I've had in a long time, and the rest of the food was hot and delicious. It was worth spending $80 on food for my family, and now this will be our go-to spot for Asian food!",
    "I was so happy to find this laundromat! It's clean, well-lit, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I was amazed at the speed of the laundry and dryer. I completed 4 oversize loads (probably equal to 8 regular loads) in just under 2 hours!\n\nThis place has security cameras, flat screen TVs, magazines, Wi-Fi, clean bathrooms, vending machines. It's a wonderful atmosphere to do your laundry. It wasn't overly busy, there are plenty of washers and dryers. I highly recommend this place!",
    "If you're looking for a late night dinner option and don't mind spending a little extra, this place is worth checking out. The garlic bread is delicious and the food is good. Just be aware that the portions are small, so you may want to consider ordering a few plates to share.",
    "The Haven is a great place to stop by for a burger during a Seahawks/Saints game. The burger I ordered was fantastic. The place was packed, but it was worth it. I will definitely be back!",
    "The service is friendly and the place is always clean. I can't comment on the Pho because I've never had it, but I would recommend the vermicelli bowls.",
    "I had the Chicken Marsala recommended by our waiter. The chicken was very thin, tough, and dry. The pasta was under cooked and stuck together. There was absolutely no flavor. My friend ordered the lasagne and did not like it all. There was only a thin layer of pasta and no flavor. My other friend was still eating her dinner and they cleared her plate when she went to the restroom, after she told the waiter she was not finished. They did bring her a new meal in a doggie bag. The positives are a Great atmosphere and live music. I enjoyed dancing with my husband. However, very expensive for awful food.\n\nI was really disappointed in the food at this restaurant. The chicken marsala was dry and flavorless, and the pasta was undercooked. My friend's lasagna was also very disappointing - there was barely any pasta and no flavor. And my other friend's plate was cleared while she was in the restroom, even though she told",
    "This place is a gem! Attractive space, great location near Broad Street line, plenty on street parking. BYOB. I've been twice and enjoyed every dish. Highlights were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads/pickles, and chai. We got the chocolate cake for the table to share each time and everyone loved it. Can get takeout beer at the corner bar. We'll be back!",
    "This is my favorite restaurant! I always order their ceviche, which is delicious. The atmosphere is fun, and the service is great. Alex was our server, and he was friendly, attentive and thoughtful. He made sure our drinks were refilled and that we had everything we needed. The ceviche was fresh and flavorful, and the perfect start to our meal. We will definitely be back!",
    "!\n\nI absolutely love this store! They have a great salad bar with fresh ingredients, and they also have a wide variety of ethnic foods to try. I highly recommend this store to anyone looking for a great grocery experience.",
    "The Mediterranean chicken shawarma at this restaurant is delicious! The chicken is cooked perfectly and is very juicy. The flavor is fantastic, and the pita is nice and fluffy. They were also very generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready to go when I arrived, and the service was great. I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in the area.",
    "If you're looking for a great vegetarian restaurant with delicious food and a pleasant atmosphere, look no further than this place. The staff are friendly and accommodating, and the space is comfortable and inviting. I highly recommend it for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.",
    "If you're looking for some good gumbo and want to be in the heart of Bourbon Street, then this is the place for you! The chicken & waffles were both delicious, and the staff was friendly. However, it did take a while to get actual service. Overall, a great experience!",
    "If you're looking for a good, quick sandwich at the airport, Earl is a great option. They have a variety of options, including roast beef, which is my personal favorite. The roast beef is cooked well and has a great horseradish sauce that really kicks up the flavor. The portion size is also generous, so you won't be left feeling hungry. Plus, it's conveniently located near the security checkpoint and the Delta SkyClub, so you can easily grab it before your flight.",
    "This place is amazing! The food and service were both fantastic. We started with an appetizer of cheese curds served with red pepper jelly and it was delicious. I ordered the fish tacos and my wife ordered a beer brat for dinner and we both loved our meals. The portions were huge and the price was great for the portion size. Our server was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. The manager stopped by and asked how everything was and I told him I had found a new cool place to hang out, have a beer and watch football. He said they have great deals on game days and told us about their brunch on the weekends. Everyone said goodbye as we walked out and reminded us to grab a rootbeer candy on our way out. I will definitely be back!",
    "If you're looking for a delicious burger and a great beer selection, this is the place for you! The wait staff is friendly and welcoming, and the food comes out quickly. The atmosphere is pleasant and the restrooms are clean. I'll definitely be back!",
    "It would be worth it to me to not have to deal with the hassle of this place.",
    "Overall, a great experience with some delicious food!\n\nI had a great time at Ava! The Ricotta cheese & toasted bread was a great appetizer, even though the bread to cheese ratio was a little off. The sausage and potato pizza was really good, but I think they forgot the Rosemary. The grouper w/Israeli couscous was scrumptious! The zeppoles were amazing, but the cherry tart was just okay. I'm definitely going to come back and try some of the other great-looking menu items!",
    "I had a great experience at this restaurant! The sushi was fresh and delicious, and the service was wonderful. I will definitely be back!",
    "This place is just the best. The chicken is really good and the fried corn on the cobs is awesome. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",
    "If you're looking for a disappointing dining experience, look no further than Pancake Pantry! The pancakes taste like they came from a frozen, processed box, the \"homemade\" maple syrup is watery and full of fake flavoring, and the hash browns are greasy and tasteless. The bacon is overcooked and hard to chew. Obviously, this is a place that is living on its outdated reputation and there are much better options in Nashville.",
    "This place is excellent! I went there for lunch and the budget option was very tempting. My wife had the prime rib po'boy with the soup of the day (tomato fennel) and both were excellent. The po'boy was an upscale interpretation with gruyere and a really good horseradish sauce. I had the seafood jambalaya and seafood gumbo which were both excellent. This is probably the best gumbo I've had.",
    "They were professional, their expertise was obvious, and their arrangements were beautiful. Our guests raved about them, even days after the event was over. I was also able to take home/give away the arrangements, which is not always the case with other florists. And the flowers lasted several days after the event.",
    "This place is great! The server immediately welcomed us and asked about our drink preferences. He was very knowledgeable and helpful. The beer selection was wonderful, the liquor selection divine. The bar food, even though it was a small selection, was excellent. I had never wanted to try pork bellies (the name turned me off.) Dan ordered it, I tried it, and we now have a convert. We highly recommend their pork belly sliders! I hope they continue to add a few more delicious tapas. These folks have it together and are very engaging. We'll be back often.",
    "If you're looking for an average burger at an above average price, then this is the place for you. However, if you're expecting anything special, you'll likely be disappointed. The burgers are good, but nothing to write home about, and the fries are nothing to write home about either. The iced tea was also just average. Overall, it's a decent place to eat, but it's definitely overpriced.",
    "I give this place one star only because our server, LaToya, was awesome. Other than that, the black bean burger was dry and the sweet potato fries were good. \n\nToday, while at lunch with a group of colleagues, the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in. They walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant. \n\nThis entire thing was poorly handled, disturbing and unsettling not only to the customers but the other staff. They should have",
    "The sliders at this restaurant are fantastic! They're the perfect size so you can try more than one. The fried chicken slider, BLT slider, monte cristo and Cuban were all fantastic! The donuts to go are also great!",
    "The food here is pretty good, especially for the price. I got the Carne Asada plate and it came with rice and beans, but they let me substitute the rice and beans for a salad. The steak was cooked pretty well. The service here is also good and attentive. I'm not sure what the specials are every day, but they seem to be pretty reasonable. Overall, this is a great place to eat.",
    "I absolutely love this little shop! The spices wafting from it are so inviting, and they have such a large variety of spices that you can smell, taste a little, and purchase. The staff is knowledgeable and more than happy to assist you in finding the right spice you need for all your cooking needs. The prices are reasonable and the products last a long time. I highly recommend this shop to anyone looking for a great selection of spices!",
    "If you're a tennis player, this is the place to go! Steve and his partner are the best, and they have a great selection of demo racquets to choose from. Prices are very reasonable, and they're always willing to help you find the right gear.",
    "I was really surprised at how packed it was when we got there around 6pm. I knew it would be busy, but the line went all the way out the door! The staff was amazing though and we only waited in line for about 8 minutes. We found a table and our food was there in less than 5 minutes. Even with the amount of people they had, it ran so smoothly. One of my sandwiches was messed up but it was very loud in there so I don't think she heard me correctly. But someone came to our table and had a new, correct sandwich almost immediately. I love that they made time to go around asking if we needed refills and how the food was. So glad to have a Chick-fil-A in Reno! They upheld the Chick-fil-A standards even with all the chaos of opening day.",
    "time\n\nThis is a great spot for wine tasting! The wines are all great, and the prices are great too. The service is top-notch, and I had a great time.",
    "Beck's is a great place to go for some good old fashioned Louisiana cooking. The portions may be a bit small, but the gumbo more than makes up for it. The chicken alfredo was just okay, but if you're looking for some good gumbo, Beck's is the place to go.",
    "I was a little worried about seeing the reviews but everything was great! Not long wait time. Staff was nice from walking in the lobby and asking which way to the office, to the office staff.",
    "Hipsters unite! The Taint is the place to be if you're looking for a good time. The staff is friendly and the clientele is top-notch. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good time.",
    "\"We're glad to be here!\"",
    "This is a great little spot on Germantown Ave. They have a great selection of cookies and bars, as well as a \"cake scrapple\" that is a must-try. The Red Velvet cake with cream cheese frosting is my favorite, but the M&M cookie is also great. The bench outside is the perfect spot to enjoy your treats.",
    "This place has really improved! The environment is much more comfortable now, and there have been lots of other great changes. The only downside is that the chairs could be a bit more comfortable - it would be nice to be able to sit through an entire football game without getting too sore.",
    "If you're in the mood for some good fast food, this is the place to go. The food is delicious, but the service is slow. I think they need 1 or 2 more people up front when placing an order if you're waiting and not using the kiosk to order.",
    ".\n\nI went to Cajun Seafood when they first opened and wasn't impressed. They only had one flavor and it wasn't great. Everything was overpriced and we left feeling hungry. It's not Cajun style seafood. The sauce tastes like a mixture of buffet style sauces with fish sauce. There are better places to eat.",
    "If you're looking for a fun, informative way to spend a few hours in Ybor City, this walking tour is a great option! Our guide Raymond was knowledgeable and friendly, and we learned a lot about the history and culture of the area. The food tastings were a highlight for me - everything was delicious, but the Cuban sandwich from Stone Soup Company was especially good. I would recommend this tour to anyone, whether you're a visitor to Tampa or a lifelong resident. Just be prepared to rack up a few steps on your Fitbit - we hit over 5,000 during our tour!",
    "If you're looking for a delicious slice of pizza, you can't go wrong with Franzone's. The sweet spiral plain pies are my personal favorite, but the white pizza with onions is also a great option. The onions add a nice touch to the pizza and it's just as good as the Franzone's I grew up with in Bridgeport.",
    "I would not recommend this clinic to anyone. My daughter had a severe sore throat and we saw another fast clinic in a CVS a few days earlier. The staff were very robotic in their behavior and it felt like I was being hurried out the door. There were no other patients in the facility during our visit and I was confused about the wait time and gruff behavior. The experience was very unfriendly.",
    "If you're looking for a great chicken sandwich in an industrial area, this is the place to go! The chicken sandwich was phenomenal, and the overall food was great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area.",
    "I had a great time on my tour with Matt! The online appointment process was very simple, and the ride was great. We had a four-seater and got to see some amazing views. Matt was a great guide and very informative. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone looking for a great time.",
    "If you're looking for a great bar with amazing happy hour deals, look no further than this place! Wine and drafts are only $3, and you can get a delicious pizza for only $5. The to-go dinners and lunches are also very reasonably priced and ready in no time. But the best part of this establishment are the staff - they are some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet!",
    "I had a horrible experience here. The waiter was great but as I got my appetizer, there was it has a hair in it. Next the noodles came out mine was fine but my friend has a huge hair in his. I thought he was joking until he told me. After that it ruined my appetite, I gave the noodles back and they didn't even give me a new one, I thought I should've got the food for free at that point.. never eating here again",
    "If you're looking for an amazing dining experience that won't break the bank, ITV is the place for you. The small, dimly-lit dining room is beautiful and intimate, and the staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming. The food is absolutely incredible - I highly recommend the Foie gras with Apricot Miso, Pork Cheeks with vegetables, and Trout Pumpernickel Soldiers. The cocktails are also some of the best I've ever had - definitely try the Ouroboros. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",
    "The staff is wonderful and the treatments are top notch. I highly recommend this place!",
    "If you're looking for the best pizza around, Buckingham Pizza is the place to go. The plain pizza is my favorite, but a few of the specialities are also worth trying - the cool ranch pizza is my favorite. This is a pizza parlor, so don't get fancy - just order the pizzas and maybe some sides. While some of the entrees are good (chicken piccata), stick with the pizza and you'll love it.",
    "If you're looking for a great iced latte and beignet in New Orleans, look no further than Cafe Beignet! The live music creates a great atmosphere, and the service is top-notch. We also visited Cafe du Monde, but in our opinion Cafe Beignet is much better. There are hardly ever lines, so you can enjoy your meal without having to wait.",
    "If you're looking for a fun, no-frills atmosphere right on the water, Captain Bill's is the place for you. You can watch passersby and dolphins alike while enjoying great food and accommodating service.\n\nOur dining party ranged from a picky 7 year old to two 40-somethings and a 72-year-old grandmother, and Captain Bill's had menu choices for everyone. They even made some ingredient substitutions for us.\n\nThe food arrived hot, fresh, and exactly to our specifications. Wait service and wait time were both excellent, and we all left the restaurant satisfied and having enjoyed the experience. We'll be back to Captain Bill's next time we visit John's Pass. I hope you'll consider it too!",
    "This restaurant is a must-visit if you find yourself near Valrico. The sushi is very good, and the peanut avocado roll is a must-try. The Volcano roll was also amazing. The service was great, very friendly customer service. I will definitely visit again even though it's far from where I live.",
    "If you're looking for some decent Cuban food and happen to be near this place, it's worth checking out. Their specials change daily and are prepared fresh, so you can get a good meal for a reasonable price. Just don't expect anything amazing.",
    "If you're looking for a nice, quiet place to have a good meal, this is the spot. My husband enjoyed his 6 oz pepperloin, and I had the shrimp kabob. Unfortunately, my shrimp were overcooked and quite small, but the service was good. Not a lot of people around, so it's perfect if you're looking to avoid a crowd.",
    "The owner came out and introduced himself to us, and we chatted for a few minutes.  He was very personable and down to earth.\n\nI would highly recommend this place, especially if you are looking for a great sandwich in a hurry.\n\nThe line was out the door, but I had a sandwich in my hands 7 minutes later. I'm guessing it took longer because I didn't know what I wanted right away. All the locals were running in, saying hi to the owner and ordering up their usual's. No place for a rookie, but they were extremely patient with us and a few others that wandered in not knowing what they were doing either.\n\nAs soon as you cross the threshold, you know you have made a good choice, the smell makes your mouth water. The Punk agreed so we decided to sit inside (everyone else was outside).\n\nTypically, I would never ever order pastrami, but the menu said it was",
    "Heather is a color wizard and a genius at crafting a look with flair just for you. She has created a shop vibe that is unstuffy, chill, and totally comfortable. I trust her and the staff she hires when I recommend friends and family, and love that she's made a home in the heart of E. Passyunk. Ask her for tips on caring for cactus houseplants, or chat about vintage bikes when you visit.",
    "I'm pretty happy with Sally's. They have more options for hair supplies than any other beauty store in the area, which is great when I feel like experimenting with my hair. The staff is nice and friendly, too. The only downside is that the store could be bigger, brighter, and cleaner. The cramped aisles, dust bunnies, and flickering, yellow fluorescent lights don't exactly give that same \"beauty/trendy\" feeling that other beauty stores have. If I could give one piece of advice to management it would be to work on the appearance of the store. Other than that, though, I'm pretty happy with Sally's.",
    "I highly recommend Rodney Mitchell Salon for your next cut or color.\n\nI have been getting my hair cut by a guy in Austin for seven years, and he is that good. The couple of times that I've strayed, I have been severely disappointed in the outcome. But I wasn't planning a trip back to Austin for a while and badly needed a cut, so I decided to bite the bullet and try Rodney Mitchell Salon. I'm so glad I did!\n\nMy friend walks in a few weeks ago with *srsly* the cutest short hair cut. And so I ask her who and where, and she says Rodney Mitchell. I figured that this place would be too expensive, but she corrected my thinking on the matter. So I called to make an appointment with her guy (whose name I sadly cannot remember at the moment) and Rodney answered the phone. Turns out the guy my friend had seen didn't do morning appointments and all my afternoons",
    "If you're looking for a place to get some work done or enjoy a good conversation, this is not the place for you. The music is way too loud and you can't get away from it. However, they do have gluten free goodies and yummy Italian sodas.",
    "4/5 stars.",
    "I was disappointed when I found out this place branched off from California. I was expecting the same great boba, but it just wasn't the same. The flavors didn't taste as natural as I'm used to, and the taro flavor was especially disappointing.\n\nHowever, if you're not too concerned about natural vs powder flavor, then this place could be good for you. They ask what level you would like your sweetness and any additional add-ons you would like. I always get boba, but sometimes the grass jelly is pretty good too! I'd recommend you try.\n\nThis is also a good place to catch up, talk, play board games, and even do homework. I know it's always busy with students from the U of A, and being told from them it's a nice area to just hang out is a pretty good sign.\n\nMaybe I'm just too picky, but I think it could be better.",
    "I have been ordering from Silver Mine's at the same location for the last 4-5 years and they have only gotten progressively worse. Don't ask for anything to be added to your soup or chili; they'll charge you for the additions but will not include them in the order. They'll also most likely to include the free side such as the bread. It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered, maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is. This business is in major trouble with all of the other options available. The service is worse than if you had a bunch of kindergarteners running the business, at least they would be nice. You guys are right next to Eller Business School, why don't you ask them how you can improve??? Currently, this place is an embarrassment to their industry, and a waste of space on University Blvd. NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN.",
    "I bought my beautiful new bike from this shop a few weeks ago and promptly crashed it (curse you, trolley tracks!). I brought it back to the shop this afternoon to see if there was any way they could try to fix the front basket, which was pretty mangled, and to give the bike a once-over to make sure it was safe to ride. I was expecting to have to leave the bike with them for a few days, but the whole process took less than a half hour. Not only did they fix the basket (not perfect, but pretty damn close), but they also fixed the gear shifter that was a little out of whack... FOR FREE. I couldn't believe it.\n\nI also want to note that everyone in the shop- from the owners, to the sales people on the floor, to the mechanics, to the dog that greets you at the door- is so friendly and welcoming. I am so happy I found them.",
    "If you're looking for a place to blow your entire paycheck in one go, look no further than this place! The prices are sky-high, but the store is like a Disneyland for adults. I absolutely loved it!",
    "Pag's is a great spot for a casual burger and a beer. The burgers are delicious and cooked to perfection. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The ambiance is perfect for a night out with friends.",
    "If you're looking for amazing Indian food at reasonable prices, this is the place for you! The service is wonderful and the staff is always willing to help. The Indian Pancake and Hainanese Chicken are my personal favorites, but everything on the menu is delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant!",
    "If you're looking for a waterfront diner with good food but terrible service, this is the place for you! The waitresses are slow and unkind, and the floor of the outside deck is covered in trash. I had to stand up several times to grab straw wrappers and napkins before they blew into the water. If you're going to have a business on the water, be responsible about it. The food was good but I won't be back.",
    "I recently had the pre fixe meal for $22 and I enjoyed the combination of tastes on my plate. The chicken was moist my veggies were tasty but a little too greasy....overall is was a great meal. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal at a reasonable price.",
    "If you're looking for a quick, cheap lunch, this place is a decent option. The food is your standard Chinese fare, but it's always ready when you go to pick it up. They have some good lunch specials, too.",
    "I finally got to eat at this restaurant last night, and I was not disappointed. The menu is very eclectic and there is something for everyone. I had the onion tart as an appetizer and it was delicious. My husband had the veal meatballs with sauce on polenta and he said it was very good. The red gravy tasted like my own. We both ordered the special of citrus short ribs with fat noodles and brussel sprouts, peas. We couldn't finish it all, but we will definitely be back to try other interesting items. The atmosphere is small and crowded but very friendly.",
    "If you're looking for a truly authentic Italian dining experience, look no further than Angelina's! From the moment you walk in, you'll feel right at home. Angelina is cooking in the front of the restaurant and her husband is servicing, and you can tell they're passionate about what they do. We ordered the eggplant and roasted pepper appetizer, veal osso bocca, carbonara, and lasagna, and everything was absolutely DELISH. Can't wait to go back!",
    "If you're looking for a great meal with an even better view, look no further than this restaurant. The lobster mac and cheese is a must-try - it's creamy, cheesy, and full of delicious lobster meat. The view from the dining room is simply stunning, and it's the perfect place to enjoy a romantic dinner or a night out with friends.",
    "This ice cream store is super tasty and has enormous portions. Some unique flavors too. Not much else to say but an amazing ice cream store that others should try to emulate.",
    "If you're looking for a place to drink on a Friday night, don't bother with this place. The drink specials are great, but it's never crowded and they always seem to be closing early. Last time I was there, it was 10 pm on a Friday night, and they announced last call at 10:15. We left and went to a different bar in the area.",
    "If you're looking for a place to order from when you're feeling those late night munchies, this is the place to go! They have a great selection of food to choose from, so you're sure to find something to satisfy your cravings. Plus, the delivery is always fast and reliable, so you won't have to wait long for your food to arrive.",
    "I found a few modern pieces here, but the prices were way too high for the quality of furniture. I also didn't appreciate the staff hanging out and chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers. The \"clearance\" section was also a joke. I would recommend shopping around town or waiting for a holiday sale if you find something you must have from this store.",
    "If you're looking for a great pizza place with an even better atmosphere, Franzone's is the place for you! The owner is always around and is super friendly, which makes the experience that much better. The pizza is delicious, and even though I'm not a fan of sweet sauce, they do a great cheesesteak as well. The fries are also a must-try! Overall, Franzone's is a great place with great food, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",
    "Bab Cafe is a fantastic new addition to the Reno culinary scene. With delicious, fresh food and a knowledgeable staff, it's a great place to get a quick, tasty meal. The Jeyuk Top-Bab is a must-try - the flavor is incredible! The sauce bar is a great way to customize your meal, and the included miso soup is a nice bonus. The downtown location is convenient for take-out, dining in, or delivery via UberEats.",
    "This was my first meal in New Orleans, and I have to say I was impressed! I ordered the $15 lunch special, a seafood stew with oyster meat, crab claws, shrimp, and redfish. It came with a salad, and I was surprised at how good it was. I'm not even a fan of seafood, but this stew was so good that I ate the whole thing. The spice, consistency, and tenderness of the meat were all perfect. If you're in New Orleans, this is definitely a meal worth trying!",
    "If you don't mind waiting a little while for your food, Biscuit Love is totally worth it! I had the vegan grits with a biscuit on the side and it was amazing. My sisters all enjoyed their choices as well. Just be warned that the bloody Marys are spicy! The service was excellent, especially considering the 45-minute wait. The line moved fast and then there was no long wait for our food. They have their process perfected! Thanks Biscuit Love for a delicious breakfast!",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and I would definitely recommend it to others.",
    "This bakery is amazing! The breakfast sandwiches are great, the coffee is delicious, and the donuts are to die for. My friend and I love coming here on weekend mornings.",
    "If you're looking for a great place to enjoy some whiskey or bourbon, this is the spot for you. They have a great selection to suit anyone's taste, and the burgers are some of the best I've ever had. The duck fries are a must-try, and the atmosphere is cute and cozy. However, if you're coming with a group, be aware that the seating can be a bit awkward and make it difficult to have conversation with everyone at your table. Overall, though, this is a great place and we'll definitely be back.",
    "If you're looking for a cozy English pub in the heart of the city, this is the place for you. The bartenders are knowledgeable and make great drinks. However, the prices are a bit high and the seating is limited.",
    "This is a cozy spot for drinks with friends, but the drink choices are limited and the food is very sweet. The servers are nice and leave you alone unless you need something.",
    "This place is the best! Every year they have hayrides, pumpkin picking, and lots of other activities. They always deliver on a great experience.",
    "If you own a high-end vehicle, don't even think about taking it to this dealership for service. You will be expected to pay for a loaner car, even if the work is covered under warranty. The staff is unaccommodating and unprofessional. Take your business elsewhere.",
    "If you're looking for a smaller version of Whole Foods, this is the place for you! They have a salad bar, fresh fruits, a juice bar, and all sorts of other great stuff. The parking lot is a great bonus, and it's just a couple blocks from clothing stores.",
    "I absolutely love coming here! Great outdoor place with a wine selection you can't find anywhere else (not your typical wines you find in the grocery). The live music today was fabulous - and on a Thursday afternoon! Come here, get a few cheeses and wine and you will be satisfied. Oh, and the regular menu is crafty and artistic.

    "If you're looking for a quick, delicious sandwich near the water, this is the place for you! The Cuban press is my favorite, but the breakfast sandwich is also great. The setting is pretty basic, but the food more than makes up for it.",
    "I'm so glad I gave this place a second chance! The food was even better than I remembered, and they seem to have worked out the kinks from the grand opening. The portion size of the garlic noodles has improved, and we had no problem getting a table on a Saturday evening. I'm looking forward to my next visit!",
    "I love Skyline Chili. I first had this stuff in Cincinnati, and I was thrilled when a location opened in Clearwater. This particular Skyline, however, is not great. The service is generally poor, and the food comes out very slowly. It seems like every time that I go, they are \"out\" of something, or some equipment isn't working. Sometimes it's baked potatoes, sometimes it is french fries, sometimes it is something else. Love the cheese coney hot dogs all the way! I hope this location can get their act together.",

    "I don't think they have enough staffs here. Always you can see customers waiting. It took them about an hour and more to have my car ready. Even worse, in the next morning before I was gonna take my family out for a trip, I found my car had no wiper fluid; hence I had no choice but went back and waste another hour waiting them to refill it.\n\nThe car was not thorough cleaned (either outside or inside). I rent the car on May 18th, extremely close to my 25th birthday (June 6th), and still, I was still charged for underage fee, which is extremely expensive -- $20 BEFORE TAX PER DAY. There was just no way to waive it. I should have gone for, and I will recommend others in the future to find another rental company such as Hertz, at which you can always find codes to waive this crazy fee.\n\nThe last thing is DO NOT buy the fuel option. Although",

All the spots where my dog had accidents are gone and everything smells fresh. I was really impressed with how dry everything was so soon after they finished. They were also really nice and gave me a lot of tips on how to care for my home. I would definitely recommend them to anyone and will be using them again in the future!",

I absolutely love that they have a drive thru too, which helps when I don't want to unload my kiddos. And their cakes are amazing too!",
    "I have been a fan of Chateau La Vin for a few years. It has been fun to watch the place evolve. At first it was more of a wine store with only a few tables. Now it has been transformed into a wine bar. He offers cheese and crackers and people order from the local restaurants and some of them even deliver. He had two guys playing music. He offers so many different wines and is willing to share his knowledge. My friend is a beer drinker and he has a nice variety for them as well. He does have a few tables out in front. This is a great place to go and relax.",
    "The Hollander Hotel is a beautiful, historic hotel located in the heart of downtown St. Petersburg, Florida. We were thrilled to use the Hollander for our wedding hotel and had an absolutely incredible experience. The staff was incredibly accommodating and went above and beyond to make sure that our guests felt at home. The rooms are clean, cozy, and reasonably priced. The Tap Room is a great place to gather with friends, and the brunch on the patio is not to be missed! We will definitely be returning for many more visits in the future.",
    "If you're looking for a delicious, authentic gyro, this is not the place for you. The gyro \"platter\" was dry, uninspired, and nothing like a deconstructed gyro. Worst of all, it came with \"vegetables\" which looked more like poop. Tasted that way, too. There are better places in Fairmount for lunch, and they won't serve you poop, either.",

The staff is unprofessional and they try to scam you with their \"coupons.\" I went in with a coupon that I found online for $15 for unlimited tanning for a week for first time customers. The lady behind the desk acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Then I pulled up the coupon and she said it's only for students and that I needed a student ID. However the coupon said nothing about this. Then she switched to saying the coupon is expired, yet it's still on YELP and their website. She also said they won't honor the $75 for 45$ coupon you can literally purchase on yelp either. Just bullshit line after bullshit line. I then left And called creve coeur location and the lady there says, \"yes you can still use that coupon, but you must go to the same location each time for that week once you choose a location.\" I knew",
    "I was very impressed with this place! The food was amazing. Quick service chipotle style line ordering but with high-quality Indian food. Also the staff was super helpful in helping me decide what to get since I'm an Indian food newbie. Can't wait to eat there again!",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by El Sabor Poblano! I was expecting your typical dive Mexican restaurant, but this place was great. The fish tacos were my favorite - they were huge and had no fishy taste. The chorizo was also really good. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this place - it's a great find in South Philly!",
    "I had a great time at this bar, even though it was during an investigation of a burglary! The bartender was great and service was prompt. I ordered a pint of dark ale and my buddy and I split a order of wings. The beer was cold and the wings were very tasty. I met the owners of the establishment at the last Italian Fest at the Farmers Market and they were very friendly, so I really wanted to like this place. I will continue to patronize this spot as it was a great spot close to home and work. I also like the locally non franchised making it work attitude that this place gives. I really was very comfortable at this establishment and I'll tell the rest of fellow Yelpers to hit this spot!!!",
    "This place is great! The reviews on Yelp are spot on - the sandwiches are delicious and the service is fast and friendly. We waited about 15 minutes in line, ordered 4 different sandwiches, filled up our sodas, walked out to our table, and our sandwiches were delivered to us as we say down. We enjoyed our meal and would definitely recommend this place to others.",
    "If you're looking for a comfortable movie-going experience, this is the place for you. The recliners are top-notch, and the bartender at the lounge next to the theaters is very friendly. However, the concessions stand could use some work. On a busy Saturday night, there were only a handful of employees working the counter, and they didn't seem to be very organized. The popcorn was also burnt. Next time, I'll eat before I come and just stick to the bar.",

    "I went to this brewery on a Sunday afternoon and there were only a handful of people there. We sat at the bar and were greeted by a bartender who started by telling us they were out of most food items. No worries, we just wanted a couple of beers. We sampled several varieties, all of which were average. Nothing memorable about any of the six styles we tried.\n\nUnfortunately, the staff was in a snit because their relief was late. I get it, but they were having a full blown discussion behind the bar which all patrons could hear. Kind of put a damper on things.\n\nCool location and cool place, but not sure we would go back based on this visit as there are better options near by.",
    "If you're looking for a disappointing, overpriced sandwich, then Tony Luke's is the place for you! I was really looking forward to trying their Philly Cheese Steak, since I'm from Philly and all. But the sandwich I got bore no resemblance to the sandwich pictured on the overhead display. The meat was especially terrible - I don't know what dog food tastes like, but I'm pretty sure I just paid $10 for it. Save your money and go somewhere else.",

I was really impressed by the quality of the art on display, especially in the African Art and Modern Art sections. Just be sure not to take any pictures in the Modern Art section, as that's not allowed. The outdoor sculpture garden and gift shop are also definitely worth checking out. Highly recommended!",

    "I was really disappointed with my experience at Terrace Lounge. The cocktails were weak and watery, and the bartenders didn't seem to know what they were doing. The service was also very spotty. I hated the people there - many of them were your typical casino gamblers. I much prefer Cin Cin, which has the best cocktails in town and no machines at the bar.",

    "Thank you for a lovely morning! I was in NJ early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast. I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).\n\nThe egg sandwich was fantastic. I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll. It was an excellent decision. The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll. They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich. It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions. I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.\n\nThe pancakes were great and fluffy.",
    "This place is a total ripoff. We paid $35 for the \"piano guys\" to sing a song to the birthday girl, and they sang an offensive, disgusting song that ruined the birthday. The sound system is terrible, too. Save your money and go somewhere else.",
    "I really like the new Han Dynasty that took over the spot of the old Mid-Atlantic restaurant. I think the food is okay, but I love the service and atmosphere. I also love that I can ask for lunch portions during lunch time which are half the price of the regular menu items.",
    "If you're looking for a delicious, authentic Spanish meal, Carisma Restaurante is the place for you! The food is fantastic, and the service is wonderful. Owner Jose is very friendly and makes sure to visit every table to ensure that everyone is happy with their meal. Tonight, we had the Paellas, salmon, and filet mignon, and everything was cooked to perfection and served hot. The family also has a cafe in front of the restaurant, and Jose gave us a tour and introduced us to his daughter, who runs the cafe. The baked goods and coffee at the cafe are just as good as the meals at Carisma. So if you're looking for a great meal and a great experience, be sure to check out Carisma Restaurante!",
    "If you're looking for a little taste of Senegal and West Africa, this is the place to go. The food is delicious and the service is friendly. I highly recommend the Thiboudienne - the national dish of Senegal. They do a version without the usual tomato sauce, and it's absolutely amazing. I also took home a Jollof Rice, which is often called the mother dish of Jambalaya. It was delicious! There are a few hightop tables inside for dining or you can order the food to-go. Either way, you won't be disappointed.",
    "If you're looking for a flavorless, extremely salty falafel wrap, this is the place for you! The falafels, pita, and tzatziki sauce were all lacking in flavor, except for the extreme saltiness. The only good part about the wrap were the fresh diced cucumber & tomato, but they were unfortunately hidden beneath the icky white sauce that doesn't even deserve to be called tzatziki. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else for a falafel wrap that actually tastes good.",

The chicken, steak, and rice/beans were all fantastic, and even the yuca wasn't bad. The plantains were my favorite though. I didn't try the salad, but it looked good too. If you're looking to try something new, definitely check this place out.",
    "If you're looking for some good southern cooking, then you need to check out this place! The pulled pork was smoky and juicy, and the sweet potato casserole and red beans and rice were both delicious. The red beans and rice were a bit spicy, but that didn't take away from how good they were. Definitely worth a visit!",

The bathrooms are especially great - they're fully stocked with all the toiletries you could need. Highly recommend!",
    "If you're looking for some decent barbecue, this place is worth checking out. The pulled pork was a little dry, but it had a nice smoky flavor. The green beans, Mac n cheese, and cornbread were all pretty average. The original bbq sauce is pretty sweet, so keep that in mind if you're not a fan of sweet sauces. I'll probably go back, but there are better options out there.",
    "This place is not worth the wait. We made the mistake of coming here on a Lenten Friday and the wait was forever. The food was alright, but nothing special. The alligator was too greasy and the oysters were fresh but I only had 3 because I have a sensitive stomach. The entrees were also not great. My husband's roast beef was salty and my kabob was bland. For the price, there are better options out there.",

Just be sure to request a table by the window when you make your reservation, or you may end up like us and get stuck in the middle of the dining room!

The drinks and food were both excellent, so we'd definitely recommend this spot for a special night out.",

I brought it to Bergeys and they discovered the timing chain needed to be replaced. Joe the service associate that took the car in was extremely rude and unprofessional to my wife, and he told the insurance company as little as possible. I brought it to another mechanic who was able to help us prove more it was from the oil. So on top of losing a service customer, I'm on the market for a new car. I would not recommend Monro Muffler to anyone.",

I got the sugar and spice pancakes and they were a bit dry, but my friends enjoyed their raspberry, sweet potato, and San Antonio pancakes. I don't understand all the hype around this place, but if the line isn't too long it's not a bad option for breakfast. If the line is longer, though, I'd recommend heading down the street to Fido for some insanely good coffee and great breakfast food.",

    "This is the best soon-dubu in the city! The place is tucked away and once you walk in, it's like you've stepped into a Korean home. It's very welcoming, warm and inviting.\n\nThe soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you. You can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain. They can adjust the spice as needed too. I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can't beat it. The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.\n\nJust thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!\n\nIf you're not into tofu, they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back), with other soup/",

    "I recently visited this columbarium to pay my respects to my father's ashes, which are stored there. I was appalled at the state of disrepair of the facility. It is clear that the owner does not care about maintaining it. The media and attorney mentioned were out of frustration, as the owner would not provide contact information so that I could appeal to her about keeping the area clean. The older area that is out of sight has been neglected for years, but we finally got tired of it and complained. He never admitted that it could be cleaned up. As for the vase, I didn't demand just one for my Dad. I stated that he should replace the cheap plastic vases on ALL the niches, as they were falling off and disintegrating. There are not very many of them. I simply thought it would be the right thing to do. If there was empathy, I did not hear it.",

I particularly enjoy veg. sausage w/ havarti on an everything bagel. I could actually go for one right about now...

We came in at 9:15 pm and were denied a dine-in experience and told that we could only get food to go, even though the restaurant closes at 10 pm. There were two pregnant women and a kid with us, and I explained that our home is an hour drive away, but they still denied us. We had to drive back home and make everyone eat there. I'm very disappointed with such an attitude towards customers. They should try to forgive themselves for denying dining to pregnant women.",
    "This place is amazing! The steak is far superior to any steak house I have been too. The staff flows together like a well trained team, the hostess Mallory, our waiter Max, and the busboy all keep things moving smoothly and leave you never wanting for anything. Honestly the whole experience was amazing and we will be back for more. Love this place!",
    "I had a great experience at this eye doctor! Dr. Dinh was very kind and addressed all of my concerns. I am very picky when it comes to choosing frames, so I was happy to see that they had a nice selection to choose from. The receptionist was also very helpful and patient with me during the process. Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely come back for my yearly exam.",
    "This place is terrible. The pizza is small and the delivery girl is rude and slow. She also tried to keep my change and said she thought I gave her a tip. Don't eat here!",
    "If you're looking for a Sonoran hot dog in Phoenix, BK's is the place to go. I'm not the biggest fan of the Sonoran hot dog (too many components for me), but the guacamole was great. The taco combo was also good, with the chicken and carne asada being my favorite. The cabeza was slimy, but the salsa bar more than made up for it. Service was good and the food arrived quickly.",
    "I was really disappointed that we didn't get a table by the window even though we had a reservation. The manager could have been more accommodating. The food was good, but the wine was overpriced.",
    "If you're looking for an amazing Indian dining experience, look no further than this restaurant! The food was fresh and delicious, and the staff were incredibly friendly and attentive. The paleek paneer and briyani were both amazing dishes that I would highly recommend. The restaurant itself was clean and welcoming, and I felt like I was really able to relax and enjoy my meal.",
    "If you're looking for the best smoothies and fresh bread in the world, look no further than this place! The staff is very knowledgeable and can help you find exactly what you're looking for.",
    "I stopped by Bell Meade during a recent visit to Nashville and I'm so glad I did! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and I even found a few bottles of bourbon that I can't get at home. The tasting bar was a great way to try a few different kinds of whiskey, and I can't wait to come back next time I'm in town.",
    "Overall, a great experience! The food was fresh and reasonably priced. The view was incredible. The service was good. I would definitely come back!",
    "The manager and wait staff may possibly be the rudest I have ever encountered. I asked if I could get brown rice instead of white and he blasted me...I offered to pay extra and he stormed off? The waitresses will smack into you while you are eating...man what a mess this place is from top to bottom.\nThe food is just OK at best! I am seriously complimenting them here... you can do better at home than here.\nI will not be returning to this establishment.",
    "I was really excited to try Nola food for the first time, but unfortunately my experience was not great. Our waitress was clearly overwhelmed and forgetful, and my friend's plate was even mixed up. My po'boy shrimp was underwhelming - there were a lot of shrimp but minimal lettuce or sauce, and the fries were soggy. Overall, it seems like we just caught them on an off day, but unfortunately that resulted in a lack luster review from me.",
    "2/5 stars\n\nThis place needs a face lift for sure. It's starting to feel shady and the service is mediocre. The comedy club doesn't feel cheerful or fun. It just feels like the back hallway of a banquet room. Great parking and good location though.",
    "*The reviewer seems to have missed the point that this is a long-term stay location and not a hotel. They also mention that the location is difficult to find and the parking is limited and expensive.\n\n**The reviewer mentions several times how quiet the location is.",
    "If you're looking for a good steak, this is the place to go. The service is great, and the location is awesome. I've been eating here off and on for the past 15 years, and I've never been disappointed. The only downside is that the steak can be a bit pricey, but it's worth it for the quality.",
    "I had the worst experience of my life and it's not over yet. I made a mistake in purchasing a vehicle that is out of my budget on a Friday afternoon. By Sunday after review of my budget I realized I was unable to afford the car. I called the salesman and tried to explain my situation at 11:30am. He stated he would speak with his manager and call me back. At 3:30 after no return call, I called him again, no answer. I left a voicemail and still no call at closing time. Monday morning I arrived at the dealership as they were opening. I asked Stephen, the salesman what they determined. He instructed me to have a seat and he would talk to his management team. One hour + later, I was called into a cubicle and told my loan had been funded and the title had been changed. Therefore, I would have to sell the car back to the dealership as a used car. I would lose a lot of",
    "If you're looking for a good Indian meal in King of Prussia, Desi Village is a great option. The food is delicious, and they're careful about accommodating allergies. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but it's worth checking out for a good meal.",
    "This place is amazing! We were so bummed when the other barbecue place ran out of food, but we're so glad we ended up here. The food was incredible from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad. We both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were",
    "Iris is one of the best restaurants in New Orleans. They have great food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting New Orleans.",
    "I stopped in at Thai House for lunch and dinner on separate occasions and was impressed both times! The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, and the staff are super friendly and seat you right away. I ordered the Pad Thai for lunch and was really pleased with the portion size and flavor. For dinner, I started with the chicken satay (which was delicious, although I would have liked a few more skewers) and then had the Panang Curry for my main course. The Panang Curry was also good, and I was happy to get a good-sized portion of rice with it. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other menu items, and in the meantime, I'll be recommending Thai House to all my friends!",
    "If you're looking for some good Middle Eastern food, Petra Restaurant is a great option. Their Friday and Saturday special rice is especially delicious - it tastes like Indian fried rice. The lamb is also very tasty. The service is good and the inside of the restaurant is quite nice. Don't be discouraged by the location - the food is definitely worth it.",
    "The Pearl is an amazing restaurant! The food, wine and service were all impeccable! We didn't realize the time and were chatting away after closing time and the staff never made us feel rushed. This is a must-go restaurant for any special occasion!",
    "I was really happy with my experience at Albertsons. I was able to find everything I was looking for, and the staff was really friendly and helpful. The store was also really clean and well-stocked. I would definitely recommend Albertsons to anyone looking for a great grocery store experience.",
    "The new owners of this restaurant have turned it into a double threat: bad food AND bad service. Shame. I loved this place. The food was always amazing, and the service was wonderful. But now, the food is terrible and the service is even worse. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",
    "Overall, we're really happy with Dr. Gloudemans. She's great with our daughter and has a great bedside manner.",
    "for me.\n\nIf you're looking for a good place to have a meeting, the Homebuilders Association of New Orleans is a great option. The food is noteworthy - I had a small cup of corn and crab soup which was fantastic, and the grits and grillades were also excellent. The portions are a bit small, but the quality of the food makes up for it. The Wi-Fi wasn't working when I was there, but based on the overall experience I would say it's worth checking out again.",
    "If you work at the Frist and are looking for a quick, gluten-free lunch option, the Cobb Salad is a great choice. The salad is packed with meat, so it's a filling option, and the oil and vinegar dressing is a nice change of pace from the usual salad options. The salad can be a bit pricey, but it's worth it for the quality and quantity of food. Just be aware that the salad is usually busiest at 11:30-12:00 on Senior Mondays and weekends.",
    "I absolutely love Ghini's! The food is just delicious and there's something for everyone. I highly recommend the eggs provencale. They're not something you can get anywhere else. The crepes are also amazing, both sweet and savory. I definitely recommend the spinach and swiss crepe.",
    "This place is amazing! The art on the walls is so cool and the food is delicious. The prices are great and the portion size is huge. I had the greek steak pita with guac hummus and it was amazing. I will definitely be back!",
    "\"I'm here for brunch!\"  They will take care of you.",
    "It's right in the heart of downtown with easy LRT access.\n\nI absolutely love the Fringe Festival! It's a great annual event that Edmonton has to offer. There's a variety of venues and plays to watch, street performers and musicians. The schedule is easy to follow and find online. I also love that half of 104th closes down to add space for a variety of food vendors and artisan vendors. It's nice to take an hour or two before or after a show to walk around and casually stumble on other street performances. Or even go without seeing a play just to snack and shop at the vendors. The location is absolutely fabulous. It's right in the heart of downtown with easy LRT access.",
    "Wow, things have changed at this location! I used to come here on a regular basis with a friend, but I haven't been back in over a year. I was surprised at the deterioration in customer service. Our server didn't smile, was unwilling to give a recommendation, and didn't offer us a tea to go. When I used to come, every server was friendly, gave suggestions, and always offered a tea to go.\n\nThe food was okay, but it would have been better if we had been treated better. I noticed there was tape on the benches where the leather/vinyl is wearing out; this looks tacky.\n\nThis used to be my favorite lunch spot, but it is no longer the case. I will not be back.",
    "but we went with a more affordable option this time.",
    "If you want the best Mexican food in Florida, you need to go to this place! I tried it for the first time and fell in love. I keep coming back because the food is just that good.",
    "If you want authentic Thai food, this is the place to go. The curries have excellent flavor, but they can seem runny if you're not used to Thai curries. I'm not super thrilled with the eggrolls, but my girlfriend always gets the veggie ones. Perhaps the meat ones are better.",
    "We had an amazing experience with Jump on the School Bus! They were the perfect choice for our pre-wedding wine and beer tour and for wedding transportation between Goleta and the Circle Bar-B Ranch. Darin and Sierra did a wonderful job communicating with us and were very flexible with trip times. They even stopped by one of the wineries to meet us and make sure everything was as expected. Our driver was also extremely knowledgeable about the area and had many good suggestions throughout the day. We couldn't have picked a better company to use and would highly recommend them to everyone!"
