The vegetable choices felt limited and there was too much rice compared to other ingredients. The sauces were tasty, but my husband's Maui roll didn't live up to the 96th street standard. Despite this, I would still return, especially for the sushi bowls. Regarding service, it's a sushi place, not McDonald's, so it may be a bit slower.

        "Improve this in GPT way": "I had mixed feelings about this place, rating it around 3 to 4 stars. While I loved the 96th street Naked Tchopstix, I was excited to try this closer location. However, the vibe was different, more focused on take-out, despite having a decent dining area. Ordering at the counter was convenient, as we could customize our sushi bowl on a piece of paper without any confusion. The sushi bowl was good, but not outstanding. The limited vegetable options and excessive amount of rice were a bit disappointing. The Maui roll, my favorite at the 96th street location, didn't meet the same standard here. However, I still think many people would enjoy the sushi bowls. I want to address the low service reviews - it's a sushi place, not McDonald's, so expect a slower pace. It's worth the wait as a healthier fast food option in the area. Lastly, I recommend trying the delicious bubble tea, like the yummy strawberry flavor. Next time, I'll go for the vanilla chai."

The Peppermill is huge and reminded us of the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  They have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want.  The casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in Las Vegas.  One thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from 30 cents to $5.  Talk about false advertising!  We were in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor.  Our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  Our room was large and featured free WiFi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), TV, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  There were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  Plenty of towels were supplied.  The roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  The thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  Staff were all courteous and helpful.  A very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.

        "input": "Write a very short and concise review based on this: The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \n\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience. ",

The waiter we encountered seemed disinterested and gave off an annoyed vibe when we asked for a table. However, we brushed it off and proceeded with our conversation. As the night went on, his distant and unengaged attitude persisted, leaving us shocked and disappointed. \n\nDespite this negative encounter, we decided to give the restaurant another chance the following night. We made sure to confirm that the previous waiter was not working, and we were pleasantly surprised by the bartender's warm and genuine welcome. This bartender, who I believe was named Ben, exceeded all expectations. He engaged in friendly conversation, recommended cocktails, and even provided us with whiskey lessons. His kindness, humor, and dedication to our experience redeemed the restaurant and bar from the previous night's unpleasantness. \n\nI also had the opportunity to order room service from this restaurant, and I was blown away by the quality.

The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\n\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \n\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \n\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \n\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip.

WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family.

The raw oysters were inadequately cleaned, so I recommend heading to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for higher quality oysters at a cheaper price of 50 cents each. The turtle soup had an unusual taste, so I personally prefer Felix's. Additionally, a portion of my boiled shrimp was consistently overcooked, resulting in a mushy texture\u2014I suspect they were boiled for too long.\n- The restaurant's ambiance is inviting, but it lacks comfort. As a result, we typically finished our meal quickly and left.\n- Lastly, the cleanliness of the bathroom definitely needs improvement.\n\nI would consider revisiting if I find myself in the area next time or if I simply want to grab some seafood quickly.

I did not have an appointment because my other plans got rained out and my dealership was too busy to take me.

I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.  Keystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and had some free coffee.  I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.   I recommend getting on their mailing list for their coupons!!!!!!!!!!

Everyone is so friendly, etc.  I'm thinking \"oh shhhh this is going to be a great weekend!\"  I checked in a few hours before my girl arrived because I had a ton of work i needed to do. So I set up my laptop ordered some room service and worked for about 4 hours straight. Left out to buy a bottle and get a mani/pedi.  My girl arrives...its about to be some trouble in NOLA... the two of us and no supervision...we pop out for dinner, come back in giggling as usual and we see it...a HUGH flying roach.  I'm freaked out.  I literally walk right out of the room down to the front desk.  I CANNOT!!!! They tell me they're sending a maintenance worker to handle it.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If there's one that's bold enough to show itself, he has other cohorts that prefer to live behind the scenes. They give us another room but tell me they can't do more until 8am.  No the room the move us too also has small spiders and other dead small bugs in the corners of the window. The TV doesn't work and one of the lamps doesn't have bulbs in it! COME ON!

I go online to my normal go to hotel, The W and book us there for the rest of the trip! 8am comes and goes no manager comes to our room. I go down and demand to see someone immediately.

I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries\n\nThe onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). \n\nSpanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good\n\nBaklava - VERY GOOD! \n\nSignature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad.

The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff!

The balsamic dressing was also great.\n- The Greek Burger (turkey) was one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had. The patty was moist and had great flavor, especially when paired with their seemingly homemade tzatziki sauce - which I could eat by the bowlful.

The chicken could use a bit more seasoning, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. \n\n- The fries - crispy and flavorful. They were so good that I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup with my fries.\n\n- The onion rings - a bit greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you took a bite (which I dislike).\n\n- Spanakopita - mine was slightly overcooked, but the flavors were really good.\n\n- Baklava - very good!\n\n- Signature Salad - The veggies they use are incredibly fresh, which can make or break a salad. Their balsamic dressing is also great!\n\n- The (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful on its own, and it was topped with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that sauce! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also requested feta, which was missing, but that sauce made me forget all about it.\n\nOverall, this place is wonderful!

The receptionist was friendly, and the owner, Dustin, even followed up to ensure satisfaction. I highly recommend Orange Tint and Tune for all your tinting needs.\""

My only complaint is that the food and drink go quickly so get there early.  You could use this as a dinner if you wanted.  I got there about 45 minutes after it started and although there was food left there were very few soft drinks left (no diet).  They could improve by keeping the area stocked throughout the period.

The breakfast provided was a standard continental spread with a few hot options, and on weekdays they also hold an evening reception. However, my only critique is that the food and drink tend to deplete quickly, so it is advisable to arrive early if you plan to utilize it as a dinner alternative. Unfortunately, when I arrived 45 minutes after it started, there were very limited soft drinks remaining, with no diet options. To improve this, it would be beneficial for the hotel to maintain a consistent stock throughout the designated period.\n\nOverall, the rooms were comfortable, the beds provided a restful sleep, and I felt safe in the area.

Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.\n\nI got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.\n\nThe sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \"made up for it\" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \"wet meat\" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.\n\nOverall, I was very disappointed with this place, the website is misleading and the food was subpar.

        "Improve this in GPT way": "I recently dined at this establishment and would like to share my experience. Our waiter recommended the Chicken Marsala, but unfortunately it fell short of expectations. The chicken was thin, tough, and dry, while the pasta was undercooked and clumped together. Regrettably, the dish lacked any notable flavor. Similarly, my friend ordered the lasagne and found it unappealing due to its thin pasta and lack of taste. Another negative aspect was when our server prematurely cleared my other friend's plate without her consent, even though she had expressed that she was not finished. However, they did make amends by providing her with a replacement meal to take home. On a more positive note, the atmosphere was great, complemented by live music, and I thoroughly enjoyed dancing with my husband. Nonetheless, the high prices do not justify the subpar quality of the food."

        "input": "Write a very short and concise review based on this: Too big, too expensive and too far from Downtown.  \n\nI was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  \n\nThe property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  \n\nRoom: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  \n\nCheckout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.

        "Make this fluent while doing minimal change": "Please write a very short and concise review of this: The hotel was too big, expensive, and far from Downtown. I attended a conference, which initially seemed great, but turned out to be disappointing. As someone in Direct Sales, I couldn't afford to spend a lot on average meals while traveling. The hotel offered a slice of generic pizza, small side salad, and a soda for $10, which felt overpriced. Unfortunately, there were no nearby dining options, and even getting our car from valet was time-consuming due to the hotel's size. Furthermore, being situated far from Nashville meant there were limited options for good local spots to explore. \n\nThe property itself was impressive and had a picturesque setting. I particularly enjoyed discovering a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center, significantly reducing my walking time. However, due to its immense size, navigating the hotel could be challenging. \n\nRegarding the room, we shared a fantastic suite in the Garden Conservatory with two friends. We were fortunate to secure a group rate where one friend was quoted $200 per night. The suite offered ample space, including a large room for socializing with a well-stocked bar area, a spacious fridge, and plenty of drawers for storage. The bedroom had lockable doors that could separate it from the rest of the suite, resembling an adjoining room. Although it differed from our expectations, it served its purpose adequately. Unfortunately, upon check-in, we discovered an issue with the billing. Our friend was charged $1200 for one room and $1400 for the other, despite reserving what she believed to be a two-room suite priced at $200. The bedroom was assumed to be included, but she was charged the full amount for both rooms. The Gaylord's legal department was investigating the miscommunication and considering whether to adjust the charges. \n\nCheck-out was a nightmare. Alongside the ongoing billing issue, we experienced a 45-minute wait for a luggage cart, despite the hotel being large enough to accommodate many guests. Additionally, it took 25 minutes for our car to be delivered. Frustrated, my friend and I opted to carry our belongings to the door ourselves, which was no easy feat considering the long distance and the amount of stuff we had.\n\nDespite the drawbacks, I anticipate having to return for future conferences, as my company has likely booked this venue for the next year. However, I will not be thrilled about it. I might even consider staying in a downtown hotel and driving to the conference, willing to pay more for a better meal and a shorter commute, simply to avoid a repeat of this experience.",

Second, they have such a large range of spices that you can smell, taste a little, and purchase. Yes, there's a large overwhelming variety of spices, but fear not! Their knowledgeable staff is available and more than happy to assist you in finding the right spice you are looking for all your cooking needs. Over the years I've purchased many items from here and I can attest that they do last a long time (about a year, year and a half, including some stuff I use often!). I see all kind of specialty salts for example (onion salt, celery salt) as well as sugars and powders (lavender vanilla sugar, vanilla bean powder). Their products even seem to taste fresher (I can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what I can get at a dollar store, for example). The prices aren't too bad and they last long. My three bottles pictured cost about $19, but that will last a good year, so its worth it to me.

While the selection may seem overwhelming, their knowledgeable staff is readily available and eager to assist you in finding the perfect spice to fulfill your cooking needs. Over the years, I have made multiple purchases here and I can confidently say that their products have a commendable shelf life, lasting up to a year, or even a year and a half for items I frequently use. Their specialty salts, such as onion salt and celery salt, as well as sugars and powders like lavender vanilla sugar and vanilla bean powder, offer a delightful taste that seems fresher compared to cheaper alternatives found at dollar stores.

Every employee I interacted with, all six of them, exuded a warm and friendly demeanor, just as expected from any Chick-fil-A. The food was great, as always, although the fries could have been cooked a tad longer. The Chick-fil-A sandwich was spot on, and the sweet tea was delightful. Bloomingdale now has a new haven in CFA! Welcome and make yourself at home!"

Everything in the room is beautiful including a lot of the staff, (im trying to give you the full picture here).   First thing to hit the table (or bar in this case) was a three dollar beef fat biscuit that was the best thing ive eaten in this city all year.  I verbally communicated that message to Chef Nick Elmi who graced us with his presence in the dining room (just as before at Laurel).

He is that good. The couple of times that I've strayed, I have been severely disappointed in the outcome. But I wasn't planning a trip back to Austin for a while and badly needed a cut, so I decided to bite the bullet.\n\nMy friend walks in a few weeks ago with *srsly* the cutest short hair cut. And so I ask her who and where, and she says Rodney Mitchell. I figured that this place would be too expensive, but she corrected my thinking on the matter. So I called to make an appointment with her guy (whose name I sadly cannot remember at the moment) and Rodney answered the phone. Turns out the guy my friend had seen didn't do morning appointments and all my afternoons were filled, so Rodney said \"look, I'm the owner, I can absolutely vouch for Allison who has several openings in the next few days.\" So I thought, alright, he's the owner so he knows his stuff--I'll do it.\n\nAllison absolutely did not disappoint. First off, she's a total sweetheart, but not super chatty (I appreciate stylists who can be content to both hold and not hold a convo while working) so there was no pressure there. I came in with my laptop and several photos I'd found that approximated what I wanted in a haircut, as I couldn't find exactly the right one. We talked about it a bit, discussed front and back length, bangs, etc. and she said alright and went to it. What she gave me was the cutest damn shaggy bob that I never thought possible. I seriously can't wait to go back.\n\nOne of the other awesome things about RMS is that they give you a discount for your first visit and I believe they have some kind of discount for students and teachers. They also will give you *another* discount when you refer people. So I got my friend a discount, and then referred a friend, so I'll get another discount when I go back for my next cut. All good things when you're trying your best to be a frugal  grad student.",

When I called, Rodney himself answered and recommended Allison, who had available appointments. I trusted Rodney's expertise as the owner, so I booked with Allison.\n\nAllison was amazing. Not only was she friendly yet not overly talkative (which I appreciate), but she also listened to what I wanted and gave me the cutest shaggy bob that I never thought possible.

        "Improve this in GPT way": "Here's an improved version generated by GPT-3:\n\n\"I was disappointed by the slow service and unfriendly waitresses at this highly-rated diner. Being located in a tourist area, I expected better. However, what bothered me the most was the amount of trash on the outside deck, posing a potential threat to the ocean. It's unacceptable. I had to constantly pick up straw wrappers and napkins to prevent them from blowing into the water. If they want to operate a waterfront business, they should prioritize responsibility by simply installing a screen on the fence. The food was decent, but I won't be returning.\"\n\nI would rate this review 2 stars. While the reviewer expresses valid concerns about the slow service, rude waitstaff, and the presence of trash on the deck, they also acknowledge the good food. However, the overall negative experience and lack of willingness to revisit contribute to the lower rating."

Think of their prices as comparable to Rothman, with the quality of Ashley Furniture. Don't expect to find any Broyhill items though. \n\nHere are some negatives: \n- Their selection of entertainment centers and TV stands is small and overpriced. \n- The \"Clearance\" section is a joke, not much of a sale. Who would pay $299 for a scratched coffee table originally priced at $350? They should lower their prices. \n- Sectionals by unknown brands average around $1,000. \n- The staff tends to hang out together in the middle of the store instead of assisting customers. \n- Their dining sets are nothing special and overpriced. You can find the same selection elsewhere for a lower price. \n- Their 5% military discount only knocks $20 off a sofa. \n\nOn the positive side, they do have a few modern pieces. \n\nOverall, I find their furniture to be overpriced for mediocre quality. It's better to look elsewhere in town or wait for a holiday sale if you absolutely must buy something from here."

The drinks were tasty and were served in very pretty glasses reminiscent of those some of our grandmothers had in their china cabinets. On the downside, all of the drinks seemed to have some combination of ginger, lime, and honey with the main difference being the kind of liquor you wanted in your drink.  So the choices felt limited.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, and have to admit that I was choking them down because I was hungry.  They tasted like they were double dipped in sugar.  Also, once another 10 or so people came in, it was very hard to hear each other because the noise level skyrocketed, which is surprising with so much fabric in the room.  The servers were nice and left us alone except to check on us every so often.  I don't recall being offered a second drink when my glass was taken away.

These tacos came with the more American toppings of lettuce and, tomato, and cheese. I bet I could have gotten cilantro and onion if I asked. The sole staff member in the place seemed happy to accommodate us- well, we were the only ones dining in.\n\nAnother taco filling option that comes with more traditional toppings is the super crispy chorizo, only $8 for 3.

One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn't have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they'd stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don't you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn't come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders, so seriously, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone, it's their turf.  They can smoke, fart, vomit on themselves, if I don't like it I can leave.  But if I'm there, it's my turf.  Don't come sit next to me and smoke, fart, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh, you don't like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.  Your life revovles around throwing away your pension money in a mindless electronic game of cards and killing yourself with carcinogens and toxins, well go kill yourself in private, seriously.  You don't see me walking up to a bar and slitting my wrists and burning my money.  It's gross.

To improve, Peppermill should eliminate the machines, train the staff, and source independent liquors. Despite these issues, Cin Cin remains the preferred destination for a quality drink unencumbered by smokers and gamblers.",
        "Improve this in GPT way": "Terrace Lounge falls short of being a great cocktail venue. One of the bartenders was unaware of the new cocktail menu, resulting in a weak and watery drink. The liquor selection throughout the establishment, including Peppermill, is disappointingly corporate. The service is also inconsistent, with four bartenders struggling to handle a modest crowd of 45 customers. Unfortunately, the lack of designated bar areas hinders personal interaction with the bartenders. Additionally, the presence of typical casino gamblers detracts from the overall ambiance. I would suggest eliminating the machines, improving the staff's training and service skills, and investing in independent liquors to create a more appealing cocktail bar. Personally, I prefer Cin Cin, where they prioritize quality beverages and keep the bar separate from the smokers and gamblers."

We ordered the blackened alligator and oysters for appetizers, the alligator came out within 15 minutes, and it was alright. A bit too greasy. Then another 15 minutes later, our raw oysters came out, I wanted mine char grilled but the waitress didn't mention they don't have char grilled oysters and still took my order, so I thought I was waiting for mine to be cooked the entire time. When she brought out the two half-dozen raw oyster trays, that's when she told me they only have raw oysters there. SMH. I have sensitive stomach so I only had 3 then gave the rest to my husband. Regardless, the oysters were really fresh. We waited for at least another 20 minutes later for our entrees to come out. At this point, I was really hungry and had hoped we were at home eating ramen noodles instead. My husband had the roast beef po-boy, and I had the tuna and shrimp kabob. My husband told me his roast beef was really salty and while ironically, my kabob was very bland. The kabob came with exactly 3 pieces of cubed tuna, 2 medium size shrimp with plenty of bell peppers and onions in between, and baby shrimp creole with rice. For the ok price, I shouldn't complain too much about this place. Didn't try their seafood boil, but it looked like that would have been a better choice. Next time, I'll stick to the raw oysters and maybe try their gumbo. 3/5 stars.",

We were seated after requested 3 times that the hostess speak a little louder because we couldn't even hear her with the background music.  We were seated in a booth with a never ending Larry King vitamin commercial on the TV - really?  Our waitress introduced herself and a new trainee and then we never saw her again.  Two other wait staff seemed to be sharing our table, but no idea who was responsible for our table.  We got our drinks and ordered, but food took forever considering there was not more than 15-20 filled tables in the entire restaurant.  Burgers were not bad - I ordered the blue cheese burger and it would have been better with less blue cheese, way too much!  Fries and onion sticks were very good.  But no one came to see if we were satisfied, needing anything, etc and took two requests and waiting to get a carry out box.

Monro's insurance company said they would pay for damages if we brought to the dealer, we were frequent customers of Bergeys so we brought it here. They discovered the timing chain needed to be replaced, a chain that lasts the life of the car unless you don't change the oil or have low oil pressure the tensioner can lock and stretch the chain. Joe the service associate that took the car in specifically said I told the insurance company as little as possible and told them he couldn't tell if it was from the oil and there was no way to tell. And on top of that, was extremely rude and unprofessional to my wife bringing her to tears the way he spoke to her. My wife and I just bought a house in the area, only 26 years old and you lost a life long customer. Over the past year we spent about $7000 in repairs here, and Joe went out of his way to be unhelpful and leave us in a terrible spot. I brought it to another mechanic who was able to help us prove more it was from the oil and do what Joe told us and the insurance company they could not do.

To our shock, Bergeys informed us that the timing chain required replacement, a component that should last the lifetime of the car unless neglected oil changes or low oil pressure cause the tensioner to lock and stretch the chain. To exacerbate matters, Joe, the service associate handling our case, deliberately downplayed the oil-related connection to the insurance company and treated my wife with extreme disrespect, even reducing her to tears. As loyal, long-term customers who recently purchased a house nearby, we are deeply disappointed in this outrageous incident. Throughout the past year, we have spent approximately $7000 on repairs at your establishment, yet Joe willingly abandoned any sense of helpfulness, leaving us in an incredibly distressing situation. Thankfully, we sought the assistance of another mechanic who was able to provide further evidence linking the issue to the oil, despite Joe's insistence that it was impossible.

In the past,  I was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day.

This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours.

Despite witnessing a decent number of early bird shoppers in the past, the store was almost deserted, with ropes blocking access to several aisles and making it quite challenging to reach the checkout.

        "input": "Write a very short and concise review based on this: --------DINNER REVIEW----------\n\nI rarely write reviews, but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences I've ever had. It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration. \n\nWe had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.\n\nIt was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention. \n\nAfter getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...). \n\nAfter ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. \n\nOnce our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. \n\nThey finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...\n\nIn summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point.

Again, multiple choices for the three courses, but I chose to start with the crisp peas/ham/garlic risotto [balls].

The dazzling dessert to finish it off was the milk chocolate + hazelnut pudding served with salted caramel and coffee to melt the chocolate, and candied almonds on the side.

We started on Frenchmen, but for whatever reason it was dead. \nDeciding to adventure Uptown we proceeded on a respectable bar crawl, including Delachaise, Columns, and St. Joes, however, at 3 AM the usual Uptown culprits start to raise their heads. A summary of the following dialogue:\n\nFriends \"Let's go to FMs\" \nMe: \"No, too much broken glass\"\nFriends: \"Let's go to Snake and Jake's\"\nMe: \"Eh....\"\nFriends: \"Brothers 3?\"\nMe: \"I'm afraid I'll hit my head on the ceiling\"\nFriends: \"The Saint!!\"\nMe: \"I suppose I haven't been there before, I'm curious.\"\n\nAfter entering the Saint the look on my sisters face was priceless, akin to a deer in headlights look. I kept my countenance, and we ordered a round. Things proceeded as expected ... unwanted dance grinding advances, check! uber drunk guy talking your ear off, check! Big Buck Hunter, CHECK!!! Overall I'm glad I moderately traumatized my sister and sated my curiosity in the same night. \n\nHelpful hint: They have outdoor seating, surprisingly, which is very good to escape the smoke filled interior.\n\nWhat do you think?

I parked in a large lot south of the pier and walked for 15 minutes to reach the restaurant. Parking was free on a Monday afternoon.\n\nOverall, this place is a must-visit for seafood lovers. The food is genuinely fresh and well-prepared, and the view adds to the experience. I will definitely be back!",

        "Improve this in GPT way": "Title: A Must-Visit Seafood Spot with Fresh Delights and Breathtaking Views\n\nReview: As an avid seafood enthusiast, I always seek out the best spots to indulge in fresh catches. However, most establishments disappoint. This place, however, exceeded all expectations. The food here is truly fresh and expertly prepared, making it a standout among its counterparts. Its picturesque view only adds to the allure of indulging in nature's delightful sundae.\n\nDuring our visit for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday, we experienced a surprisingly busy atmosphere despite the time. After a brief 25-minute wait, we secured an outdoor table, albeit under the direct sun with no shade. Nonetheless, the mesmerizing view made it all worthwhile.\n\nOpting for the local crab special, we were treated to a succulent 3-lb. steamed crab accompanied by a satisfying salad and soup, all just for $26. This was undoubtedly a steal considering the sheer size and delectable meat of the crab. The garden-fresh salad added a simple yet refreshing touch, while the lobster bisque was quite enjoyable. The crab was further complemented with delicately prepared onion rings, cocktail sauce, and drawn butter \u2013 a true feast for the senses.\n\nAdditionally, we ventured into the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari, and scallops, priced at a reasonable $12.95. Served alongside cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce, and cocktail sauce, this platter showcased the epitome of freshness. Even the oft-dreaded fried oyster proved to be a delightful surprise.\n\nSipping our iced teas under the scorching sun, the ice melted swiftly. Fortunately, our attentive waitress promptly provided extra ice and an additional iced tea to combat the heat. Her friendly demeanor and efficiency unquestionably earned her a well-deserved five-star rating.\n\nBy the time we departed around 6 pm, a sizable crowd had gathered, emphasizing the place's immense popularity. To secure a seat, it is advisable to sign up on the clipboard upon arrival. The restaurant resides right at the pier's end, and while parking is free for 90 minutes, the pier's surfaces may concern tire-conscious individuals. Personally, I opted for the large lot south of the pier, which only required a pleasant 15-minute walk.\n\nIn conclusion, for seafood lovers, this place is an absolute must-visit. With its genuinely fresh and expertly prepared dishes, it truly stands out. And let's not forget the breathtaking view that acts as the ultimate finishing touch on nature's splendid sundae. Without a doubt, I will be making a return visit in the near future."

I made a mistake in purchasing a vehicle that is out of my budget on a Friday afternoon.  By Sunday after review of my budget I realized I was unable to afford the car.  I called the salesman and tried to explain my situation at 11:30am.  He stated he would speak with his manager and call me back.  At 3:30 after no return call, I called him again, no answer. I left a voicemail and still no call at closing time.  Monday morning I arrived at the dealership as they were opening.  I asked Stephen, the salesman what they determined.  He instructed me to have a seat and he would talk to his management team.  One hour + later, I was called into a cubicle and told my loan had been funded and the title had been changed.  Therefore, I would have to sell the car back to the dealership as a used car.  I would lose a lot of money in doing this.  This morning, Bill head of finance advised that the bank had questions about funding the loan.  I received a call from the bank stating the loan had NOT been funded and they would be unable to okay the loan.  I have left numerous messages with the dealership and have yet to receive a callback.  I contacted an attorney and per his review I again called the dealership and asked for a time to return the vehicle and take back my trade.  Still no response!  These people will lie to your face, avoid this dealership!!!\"\nBased on this review, I would give the dealership a rating of 1 out of 5 stars.

I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken. \n\nAll the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets. \n\nWe settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet).
