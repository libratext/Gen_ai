    "Overall, the food is good but the service is slow. Despite multiple visits and positive experiences at other locations, the wait time at this particular restaurant can be excessively long. The young waitstaff is generally pleasant, but the consistent delays in receiving our orders have led us to choose alternative dining options on weekends for a quicker experience.",
    "Body Cycle is hands down the best spin studio I've experienced. The facilities are immaculate, the bikes are top-notch, and the instructors are motivating. The online scheduling system is convenient, and the owner, Russell, is passionate and dedicated. His continuous support and positive attitude make every class exceptional.",
    "I recently had a great experience at the family diner next to Clarion Hotel. They offer an eclectic buffet with a variety of tasty options including a large chicken leg, fried jalape\u00f1os, tamales, rolled grape leaves, and fresh melon. The Mexican choices were particularly impressive. The staff was friendly and attentive, making it a perfect place for a casual, relaxed meal. Additionally, their all-day breakfast menu is a great feature. Highly recommend for a no-fuss dining experience.",
    "Delightful flavors and ample variety! The lamb curry and korma are our top picks. Impressive naan selection too. Ignore the unassuming exterior and venture inside for a deliciously unique experience. Definitely worth it!",
    "The cute interior and the owner's tour of the upcoming patio/rooftop area were highlights. The cheese curds were delicious and satisfying. Appreciated the salad that came with the sandwich, although the onion, gruyere, tomato combination needed an additional element like pepper jelly. It would be great to see more menu options with fun cheeses, as there is a good variety of beer, wine, and limited cocktails available. Will definitely try one of the draft wines on the next visit.",
    "As a long-time customer, I was extremely disappointed with my recent experience at this establishment. Despite the place being relatively empty, I was informed that they were too busy to accommodate my takeout order. This level of poor customer service and disrespect is unacceptable. Thankfully, I have found a new favorite restaurant in Kanella and will not be returning to Dmitris.",
    "Highly recommended tour! Perfect way to explore New Orleans for first-timers. Knowledgeable guide with interesting tidbits about the city. Unexpectedly covers both French Quarter and cemetery. Convenient meeting point and bathroom break during the tour. One of the best parts of my trip!",
    "Incredible wings, homemade bleu cheese, and a mouthwatering ribeye. Fantastic craft beer choices. A definite hidden gem worth checking out!",
    "Los Padres National Forest offers stunning natural beauty, however, improvements are needed in maintenance. White rock area requires attention in terms of removing dead grass which affects both the rock and water. The cleanliness of the water leaves much to be desired, as it appears green and dirty. The staff should work harder to maintain the forest's aesthetic appeal and prevent it from resembling a dump, as even Cachuma lake seems to have a higher level of care and effort.",
    "I had a party of 6 for hibachi here. Unfortunately, our waitress mixed up our sushi orders and forgot some items. The restaurant was quiet and lacked the lively hibachi experience. Our cook, Francisco, did a great job though. The service was off, the food was decent, and based on the experience, I won't revisit considering the price.",
    "My experience with Shalimar was absolutely wonderful. They accommodated my same-day request to resize my engagement ring for a very reasonable price. Even though I made a mistake in determining the size, they were understanding and resized it back up within an hour at no charge. Their excellent customer service has earned my loyalty. Very grateful for such a great experience.",
    "Milktooth is an incredible gem in Indianapolis, highly recommended by locals. I'm grateful for the opportunity to have experienced it.",
    "I love this place for happy hour or dinner! The patio is great with fans to keep you cool in the StL heat. The staff is very accommodating and they even modified the menu to suit my taste. I highly recommend the Veal Milanese with mixed greens instead of pasta!",
    "Great food overall, especially the gnocchi with marinara and baked eggplant appetizer. Though the service was slow, the deliciousness of the food makes me want to return.",
    "This review praises the Sonoran Dog for its bun, comparing it to a cozy snuggie. It acknowledges initial skepticism but highlights the bun's warmness, softness, and fragrance, attributing its success to surpassing other Sonoran Dogs. The reviewer suggests that the hot dog or bacon could have more texture to balance the strong flavors of mustard and onions. They also express admiration for the carne asada caramelo, particularly praising the tortilla, cheese, and carne flavors. Finally, they mention that the meal is affordable and convenient as it can be purchased via a drive-thru.",
    "Excellent breakfast spot! Fluffy and perfect waffles, and the home fries were nicely smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff, will definitely return!",
    "Excellent service and delicious food at this pricey establishment. A special thanks to Douglas for the outstanding service. The atmosphere rivals top tier restaurants nationwide.",
    "My husband and I have had multiple wonderful experiences at this restaurant. The staff is knowledgeable and always accommodated my dietary needs as a Celiac. The wine and cocktail menus are excellent, and the food is divine. The only small downside is the lack of gluten-free desserts, but that won't stop us from returning again and again.",
    "I highly recommend Natalie as a brow specialist at Blow Bar. She does a fantastic job on my eyebrows. Additionally, Victoria gave me the biggest volume I've ever had for my thin, straight, and lifeless hair. Although I tried another stylist, I didn't like the results as much. Victoria will be my go-to stylist from now on. The place is also beautiful and clean.",
    "This is by far my favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is the best I've ever tasted, with its perfect balance of sweetness and foam. The soups are consistently delicious, even for those who aren't typically soup fans. The spacious environment is ideal for working, with a perfect noise level and just-right music. Plus, it's always a delight seeing patrons bring their furry friends along. I'll continue to be a loyal customer for as long as possible.",
    "Incredible combination of frozen custard and real pumpkin pie. The chunks of pie crust are an absolute delight. This treat deserves to be a nationwide sensation. Super yummy!",
    "Upland offers great beer and food, but their pizza fell short. The margherita had a light, cracker-like crust and lacked flavor from the toppings. While it could work as an appetizer, I'll stick to their delicious burgers and tenderloins as my go-to meal at Upland.",
    "The show was thoroughly enjoyable, providing a chill way to spend a Friday night.",
    "This is the go-to sushi place in town when you need a quick fix. The salmon is top-notch, and we can't resist the spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. Friendly and quick service adds to the overall positive experience.",
    "I was excited to try this location of Naked Tchopstix, but I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars. The vibe is different, more geared towards takeout, but they have a good-sized dining area too. Ordering at the counter was convenient, and I liked the customizable sushi bowl concept. However, the vegetable choices felt limited, and there was too much rice in proportion to other ingredients. The Maui roll didn't meet the same standard as the 96th street location. Despite these issues, I would still go back for the sushi bowls. The service may be slower, but it's worth it as a healthier alternative to fast food. And don't forget to try the yummy bubble tea, like the strawberry flavor!",
    "Had an amazing lunch with an awesome beef brisket sandwich\u2014juicy and tender. The pulled pork was equally delicious!",
    "The best Thai food in the area! Authentic and delicious. Will return frequently.",
    "The service was poor and the food was average. Regret choosing this place for my final dinner here.",
    "Had an amazing dinner with my wife. Quick service, delicious homemade food, and a vast menu to choose from. Excited to come back for more!",
    "Decent food, but poor service. Had to flag down the assistant cook for avocado and he refused to help. Disappointing experience after spending $100 on food.",
    "I had an incredible first experience at this restaurant! It exudes a cozy, homely atmosphere, and the waiters were friendly and entertaining. The food arrived promptly, and it was absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely return to this amazing place!",
    "Overall, I highly recommend this place for their fantastic burgers, fries, and salad. The burgers are perfectly seasoned with a subtle salt and pepper flavor. The outdoor seating creates a charming atmosphere. The staff is friendly and the location provides convenient street parking or a parking lot in the back.",
    "The staff at this store is amazing - always helpful and friendly. The place is clean and spacious. They have everything you need and make fantastic custom breakfast bagels.",
    "Took my vehicle for recall work a few years back. Issue resolved, but a new noise emerged. Kevin and his mechanic identified it as a separate problem and fixed it at no cost, despite my offer to pay. Exceptional service, highly recommended!",
    "I absolutely love my local Sweet CeCe's! The product is amazing, and the selection of toppings is great - a good balance between healthy and indulgent. However, occasional lapses in service where the staff seems distracted can be a minor inconvenience. Despite that, my love for Sweet CeCe's earns them a solid 4 stars!",
    "The Funk Zone just got better with this new addition. Amazing food options and wine tastings at the Santa Barbara Wine Collective. Don't miss their savory croissants, they're fabulous.",
    "The Center is a fantastic place for a massage! They offer a serene and calming atmosphere, with same day appointments readily available. I have always had incredible experiences with their therapists, never leaving disappointed.",
    "The Peppermill is a huge hotel with easy check-in and complimentary valet parking. The casino area is expansive, but be aware of false advertising when it comes to minimum bets on slot machines. Our room in the Tuscany Tower was spacious, with a great view and excellent amenities like free WiFi and a large bathroom area. The staff were friendly and helpful. Overall, a nice place for a comfortable stay.",
    "We tried this deli for the first time today and were impressed. I had a delicious turkey, avocado & bacon panini and my boyfriend enjoyed his buffalo chicken wrap. The wait for food was reasonable, especially during lunch hour. The deli had a wide variety of options including salads, soup, macaroni, sandwiches, and hot food. We loved the extensive selection and will definitely return.",
    "The biscuits are amazing and (fill in the blank) is delectable. Cocktails are top-notch. Highly recommended, although it can get a bit busy.",
    "The food was delicious, with a menu that falls in between Outback and Bonefish. The atmosphere and decor resemble a fishing lodge, which adds to the experience. We used a Groupon and all three of our meals, as well as the calamari appetizer, were cooked perfectly. We had a great time and will definitely return.",
    "This place is cheap and conveniently located, but the food leaves much to be desired. The desserts are good and the service was excellent, but the meat slicing station, shrimp, and Mexican station are average at best. The breakfast options, eggs in particular, are terrible. The steak and breaded items are also disappointing. Additionally, the decor is outdated. Despite giving it three chances, this place failed to impress.",
    "Overall, I had a mixed experience at this restaurant. The location is great, being at Hotel Palomar, but one pretentious waiter left a negative impression. However, the bartender, Ben, was exceptional and made us feel welcomed and valued. The room service was also excellent, with delicious dishes like bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake. It's a shame that one bad egg could have tainted an otherwise great experience.",
    "Stopped by after a morning walk - amazing food, coffee, and service! Love the vibe!",
    "Overall, the experience at this restaurant was disappointing. The wait for the food was excessively long, and the burger, despite being ordered medium rare, was overcooked. The Seafood Jumbalaya was decent, but not worth the price. There are definitely better dining options in the French Quarter. It wasn't terrible, but considering the hype surrounding this place, I expected much better.",
    "I was thoroughly impressed with this place. The bed was comfortable, breakfast was good, and the internet was fast. Its great location and low price were definite highlights. However, be aware that staying on the top floors may result in waiting up to 15 minutes for an elevator in the morning.",
    "This restaurant falls short in providing basic services; patrons are expected to fetch their own water, drinks, and endure a dirty outdoor seating area with uncomfortable chairs. The wait staff is minimally helpful, only delivering food after payment at the window. Comparable to New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, with live music but lacks cleanliness. I wouldn't recommend returning.",
    "This restaurant offers a pay-as-you-go style dining experience. The food was neither exceptional nor disappointing. The server accommodated my request for spicier salsa and pico de gallo. However, they did not inform me that only bottled drinks were available for Coke. Additional charges were applied for condiments, resulting in a higher bill for condiments than the actual food. It is advisable to inquire about extra charges when ordering.",
    "The cafe was adorable with a surprise jazz band performing when we arrived at 8am. The breakfast sandwich was scrumptious - the rolled egg and bacon pieces were a delightful touch. It was a reasonably priced and satisfying morning meal.",
    "This place is incredible! The duckfat french fries are a must-try. We had to wait for about 45 minutes, but the experience was worth it. Keith, the bartender, was friendly and knowledgeable. The cape may salts and tater tots were delicious starters. The Kentucky Fried Quail was stellar, but the succotash was a bit disappointing. The $24 Fois Gras burger was absolutely incredible. The duckfat fries were yummy, but not the best part of the meal. Can't wait to come back here with friends and family.",
    "The artichoke dip was disappointing - cold and served with stale chips. Not much was done when we informed our waitress. The thin crust pizza was decent but overpriced. Our server was fine but failed to address our concerns. Previous experience during a Cardinals game was better. Will try a different place next time.",
    "Jasmine Rice is a good, laid-back Thai restaurant recommended by Yelp. The pan-fried dumplings were decent, but not worth ordering again. The green curry fried rice with duck was fantastic, with the tastiest duck ever. The chicken pad thai was a bit sweet, so we would try a different noodle dish next time. Service was good, but others had some issues. Despite that, the overall experience was great and we would definitely return.",
    "Courtney is an outstanding hairstylist who always knows what will look best on me. She understands my style preferences and consistently exceeds my expectations. Her talent and expertise are truly impressive. Without even specifying, she knows exactly how to enhance my look. In addition to her exceptional skills, Courtney has a wonderful personality and a wealth of knowledge. I highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their absolute best.",
    "I've frequented this chain location many times while living in the area. It may not be glamorous, but it gets the job done. They offer oil changes and state inspections, but be sure to go when they're not busy to avoid a wait. It's a no-frills experience, but overall decent.",
    "I replaced 2 old 70s Lennox units with new ones and they have been running smoothly for 3 years. Great job!",
    "I love the Brewpub for their diverse menu of nachos, pizza, and sandwiches, along with a great selection of on-site crafted beers. The slow service seems to be a result of the restaurant's laid-back pace, encouraging patrons to relax and enjoy the company of friends on the patio. The establishment is kid and dog friendly, catering well to vegetarian and vegan diets. Personally, I enjoy the half order of nachos or fish & chips. Their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer rivals some of my favorite pumpkins.",
    "Absolutely loved this farmhouse, rustic, chic store! The staff was incredibly helpful and offered fantastic decorating tips. Prices were reasonable, and the store had an impressive selection, including items from Joanna Gaines. Finally found a great home store in SB with reasonable prices.",
    "My brother and I stumbled upon this gem of a place while looking for a six pack. Ended up enjoying great beer, playing Nintendo 64, and connecting with friendly people. The food is tasty too. Definitely a must-visit spot in the Northeast!",
    "I absolutely love their coconut soup - creamy and balanced with herbs. The pad thai was also delicious, with generous amounts of peanuts and perfectly cooked noodles. The chicken was tender and not dry. Very satisfied with my meal!",
    "Great service, delicious diner food, and they serve breakfast all day. Despite being busy, the staff was friendly and welcoming. Conveniently located off the 295.",
    "Love this place on a Saturday night! Was sad about Lucy's closure, but found this bar across the street which surprised me in a good way. Their food, especially wings and fries, is surprisingly good. Just be cautious of the wtf sauce. It can take a while to get the bartender's attention due to the crowd, but that's because the place is usually packed. Plus, you might even catch a glimpse of the Always Sunny crew if you're lucky!",
    "We were hesitant to try the Shellfish Company due to past experiences with similar seafood places, but the positive Yelp reviews convinced us otherwise. The small restaurant requires planning and a wait, but our 20-minute wait during dinner rush was worth it. The $25 special of 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and choice of soup/chowder was a good deal. The rock crab was delicious and easy to crack, providing ample meat. The salad and chowder were satisfying, but the Shrimp Bisque was exceptional. Overall, a great value and one of our favorite meals on the trip. Ordering crab here is highly recommended.",
    "I love Weaver's Way and disagree with previous reviews. It's not meant for convenient shopping, but as a single woman, I find it great for smaller quantities. The community is diverse, not just \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children.\" They offer locally grown produce and preservative-free foods at better prices than Whole Foods. Interacting with members and contributing to the community is enjoyable. The membership fee and work hours aren't prohibitive for singles. If you value Weaver Way's values, it's the perfect place to shop. Otherwise, stick to chain stores or pay the visitors' fee occasionally.",
    "The food at this place is not impressive, but it seems popular among others. I only go because my husband enjoys it, but I would prefer a different BBQ spot. It may vary depending on your choice of dish.",
    "The TV shows priced at $4.99 with commercials is disappointing, indicating a lack of class and cheap money-making tactics for a hotel charging over $150 per night. Additionally, the absence of a complimentary breakfast and the presence of an expensive buffet is surprising, as even the most affordable hotels in California offer this amenity.",
    "Conveniently located near my hotel, this shop offers a great buy one get one deal. The staff is extremely friendly, and the hot wings were delicious with a generous amount of sauce. Will definitely return for their tasty pizza on my next visit!",
    "Termini Bros' cannolis are absolutely fantastic! The freshly filled shells and phenomenal filling make for a perfect balance of sweetness. Whether you're a cannoli lover or not, you must try one from here.",
    "We stumbled upon this incredible cafe while traveling in our RV and it was an absolute gem. The staff was amazingly friendly and the food was just like home cooking. We ended up eating here twice because everything was fresh, delicious, and felt like a homemade meal. Highly recommended. Yum!",
    "After 3 weeks of searching, I found a hidden gem off of Magazine with an awesome staff and delicious Ph\u1edf. Definitely not overrated!",
    "We consistently enjoyed impeccable food and service during our breakfast visits. Highly recommended!",
    "The kayaking tour at Santa Cruz Island exceeded our expectations with a great experience exploring caves. Our tour guide, Jen, was informative and helpful, making the trip wonderful.",
    "Highly recommended! Delicious meal, reasonable price. Must try the shrimp and goat cheese crepes!",
    "I am ashamed and remorseful for not trying this St. Louis tradition sooner. This place is amazing with a factory tour, shop, bar, and dining area. They host events with live music and the beer is fantastic, especially the Hefeweizen. The food is homegrown and delicious, with a spectacular pizza and a great bison burger. The service is excellent, and the emphasis on local food and brewery is commendable. It is a bit pricey, but worth it for the experience and quality. I will definitely be going again and you should too!",
    "Terrible service and lack of apology for putting bacon in my plain hamburger, despite being allergic. Will not be returning.",
    "Excellent service and top-notch car wash. I am extremely satisfied with my first visit. Thank you!",
    "Sushi Nara is a new spot on the eastside that I highly recommend. The restaurant is clean, the staff are friendly, and the service is fast. The sushi is consistently delicious and the prices are reasonable. I especially love the freshness of the food and the wide variety of options. Definitely worth a visit for sushi lovers in the area!",
    "The shop is fantastic with a knowledgeable and passionate owner. They offer unique tires and parts not found elsewhere.",
    "I've been here numerous times and the food is consistently delicious. A hidden gem in Florissant, their Panang curry is the best. Although I haven't tried their sister restaurant, I can't help but always come back here for their satisfying fare.",
    "Overall, my dining experience only deserves two stars. However, I'll add one extra star for their appealing menu and innovative design. Unfortunately, the tomato-basil soup tasted like a weak marinara and the tuna melt had an unpleasant, sharp flavor, possibly due to overpowering lemon zest. Next time, I'll opt for dishes featuring cured Italian meats like mortadella and prosciutto, as well as their enticing baked goods, with the Nutella bruschetta being a standout option.",
    "My spouse and I were quite let down by our visit; the veggie pizza lacked flavor and the sub sandwich failed to impress. Disappointing tomato sauce and insufficient cheese on the pizza. The dough seemed machine-made and lacked freshness. We may give them another chance someday, but not in a hurry.",
    "My friends and I enjoyed our visit to More Than Just Ice Cream for late night milkshakes. The coffee and chocolate milkshakes could have been thicker, but the black&white malt was the standout. I regret not trying the pumpkin pie flavor, which was amazing. Next time, I might opt for ice cream instead of milkshakes.",
    "The birthday celebration at this restaurant exceeded our expectations in every way. The fantastic table with a view, the complimentary dishes from the chef, the beautifully decorated cake plate, and the attentive servers made it an unforgettable experience. Highly recommended for special occasions.",
    "Great ambiance, excellent bartender, and delicious fresh burger with local ingredients. Impressive-looking dishes and cold beer. A genuine local gem, not just another chain restaurant.",
    "Overall, this restaurant is convenient for nearby hotel guests and has good opening hours. They offer a great deal on oysters and have a seafood shop next door. The friendly server is a plus. However, the food quality is mediocre with poorly cleaned oysters and strange-tasting turtle soup. Some dishes, like boiled shrimp, were consistently overcooked. The restaurant has a pleasant ambiance but lacks comfort. The bathroom needs improvement. I may visit again if staying in the area or for a quick seafood pickup. 3 stars.",
    "This restaurant is a complete disaster. The server had no idea what she was doing and seemed completely lost. We had to constantly ask for basic things like setups and water refills. To top it off, they completely messed up our order and served us eggplant parmesan instead of chicken, complete with a fish bone. The only redeeming quality was the good drinks. Overall, I would strongly advise against dining here.",
    "TDS left me unimpressed. The restaurant lacks any charm or ambiance, with bare minimum decor and no menu boards. The use of stainless steel prep tables as dining tables felt cold and unwelcoming. The absence of identification on the staff further added to the lackluster experience. Although the food was reasonably priced and mostly delicious, the fact that they charged for extra salsa was a major disappointment. We ordered a salsa trio and when my brother requested more salsa for his tacos, he was informed that he would have to purchase the trio again. This seemed unreasonable considering we had spent over $40 on various items. Overall, despite the decent food, I wouldn't consider returning due to the uninspiring atmosphere and the inability to get extra salsa for tacos.",
    "Angela Clifton Photography has exceeded our expectations in every way. We've worked with them 3 times now, and every single picture captured has been outstanding. The photos are not only beautiful but also reflect the fun and enjoyable experience we had during the sessions. Considering the amazing quality, their pricing is more than reasonable. We are absolutely thrilled with our pictures and they will always hold a special place in our hearts.",
    "Had a great experience dining outdoors with delicious food at a sidewalk table! The prices were a bit high, but worth it. For a quieter atmosphere, I recommend trying Side Street in the French Quarter.",
    "The courthouse is ancient, showcasing remarkable art. The spiral staircase is amusing, while granting a panoramic city view on the 5th level. The clock room is an unexpected delight, exposing intricate mechanical gears. Remember to book ahead for access. Allocate 2 to 3 hours\u2014it's truly worthwhile.",
    "Ann was incredibly helpful and positive during my first visit. She went above and beyond to ensure that I had an amazing experience. Thanks to her, I am now a regular customer. Thanks, girlie!",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The combination dinner of pad Thai and coconut soup was delicious. The restaurant had a charming Thai decor and the staff provided excellent service. It's a great alternative in a town with limited food options. I might just make this my regular spot in Carp.",
    "This place was a delightful, relaxing experience. The artist's fun and eclectic performance, including a country version of \"Let It Go,\" was truly memorable. It will certainly be on my list of stops when I return.",
    "The newly renovated Smoothie King Center exceeds expectations with its updated facilities and a wide array of food and drink options. The quality of the food has vastly improved, and the drink selection now includes full service bars and unique options like spiked lemonade. The venue now feels luxurious and upscale, and overall it's a definite upgrade.",
    "Chipotle's steak is my go-to remedy for an upset stomach. Avoiding peak lunch hours, I opt for a peaceful visit between 2 and 4 pm. Regardless of the crowd, their service remains friendly and efficient.",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by this Indian restaurant. The ambience is great with white table linens, and the food was amazing. The chicken 65 was delicious and the hot sour soup was flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this place for authentic Indian cuisine.",
    "The wait was worth it! Reserved seats saved us the hassle and the show was amazing. Talented musicians with great personalities in an intimate setting. A must-do in NOLA!",
    "I had a great experience at Keystone Discount Tire! As a new customer without an appointment, they took my car in for a PA State & Emissions inspection while I waited. The technician was kind enough to let me see a minor issue with my tires that can be fixed with an alignment. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and didn't try to upsell me. My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour. I highly recommend signing up for their mailing list for coupons!",
    "I'm thrilled with the professional and excellent service! My son's phone was fixed in less than half an hour, even after he dropped it. Wow!",
    "Terrible service and management at Cracker Barrel. Our orders were all messed up and the waiter responded with anger and cursing. The manager only offered free drinks as compensation for the chaos. The food was cold, nasty, and barely touched. Waited over an hour. Will never dine in a Cracker Barrel again after this experience.",
    "I have visited many dog friendly hotels, but this one exceeded my expectations. Located in the heart of the city, I was pleasantly surprised by the warm reception and exceptional service provided. The staff immediately put me at ease and even offered a welcome kit for my dog, including dog dishes, a mat, and treats. The guests at the hotel were also very friendly and took the time to compliment and pet my dog. The room on the top floor was great, and even the car attendants greeted my dog by name. I was so impressed with the service that I extended my stay. Thank you, Loews, for showing me that a hotel can truly be dog friendly, even for a large dog like mine.",
    "The food can be excellent at times but lacks consistency. There seems to be varying quality depending on who is in the kitchen. It's frustrating that the experience is only great half of the time. Ugh.",
    "I visited this location twice and had an extremely disappointing experience both times. The first visit was mediocre while the second visit was unbelievably bad. I ordered ribs and had to send them back because they were unevenly cooked, with one half warm and the other half refrigerator cold. Despite sending it back twice, the issue was not resolved until the third try. The manager apologized but didn't offer any compensation. I normally don't expect freebies, but receiving an insincere apology after three attempts to get my meal cooked properly really angered me. I won't be returning to this place.",
    "I personally found the ramen at Cheu underwhelming due to the thick noodles and overly salty broth. However, the service was excellent, and they had a good variety of beers. While my friend enjoyed it and has been multiple times, I regret not being a bigger fan. Nonetheless, I encourage others to give it a try as my opinion might be an outlier.",
    "Federal Doughnuts at the ballpark is a delicious addition, serving up both doughnuts and fried chicken. And for those with dietary restrictions, the new gluten-free concession near 136 offers a variety of tasty options including pizza, cheesesteaks, brownies, and cookies. A satisfying treat for everyone at the game!",
    "The new Red Kings restaurant in Chinatown exceeded expectations with its flavorful, spicy Szechuan cuisine. The takeout experience was fantastic, with generous portions and perfect spice levels in the Dan Dan Noodles and Pork in Garlic Sauce. The sweet, earthy, and fresh flavors were delightful. Excited to explore more dishes and return for a sit-down dinner. Additionally, the karaoke rooms upstairs and BYOB option make it even more appealing.",
    "This Chick-fil-A is consistently efficient and provides exceptional service despite its high volume. Impressive speed and quality make it one of my favorite spots!",
    "Best place for salads! Fast service and consistently fresh veggies. I always stop by for lunch when in town.",
    "We had an excellent experience on the Oak Alley and Laura Plantation tour. Our driver was knowledgeable and provided great insights during the drive. The schedule was well-balanced, allowing us sufficient free time to explore the properties before and after the tour. The flexibility in drop-off locations made it convenient for us to continue our day in the French Quarter. Overall, a highly recommended tour.",
    "Highly recommend this place for brunch! The food is delicious, especially the grits with scallions and sour cream. Just remember to bring a sweater as it can get quite chilly in the room.",
    "This place is a must-visit for the best hot dogs and chili dogs. I can't get enough of them and constantly come back for more. Absolutely delicious!",
    "Great live music venue with the best local beer in town. The concept is a step up from Fig Mountain. Topa is the preferred choice. The added bonus of ordering amazing food from the Nook Restaurant and being able to walk to Lama Dog makes it even better. Love it!",
    "Excellent customer service! They were incredibly accommodating, even picking us up outside their usual area. When we realized there was an overcharge on our bill, they quickly refunded the extra ticket. The tour itself was amazing. Our tour guide was funny, and we had a blast seeing alligators, turtles, and birds. Holding a baby alligator was a unique experience, and the boat ride back was thrilling. Highly recommended!",
    "Westfall replaced our roof in April and we are extremely satisfied. From the quality of the new roof to their exceptional communication and follow-up, we couldn't have made a better choice. Highly recommend this company!",
    "This vegan fast food joint offers delicious food at reasonable prices, with a friendly staff. Although not the best for dine-in, it matches their fast food concept. While the buffalo bella is highly promoted, I recommend trying their tasty Cheesesteak. And don't miss out on their fantastic sweet potato fries\u2014highly recommended.",
    "The ramen is decent, but not outstanding. Service is average. It's a convenient spot for a quick bite, but I wouldn't choose it over other options. I've been here twice and will likely visit again.",
    "Highly recommend this place with its satisfying menu and trendy, clean atmosphere! Get there before 9 am to beat the crowd and enjoy the deliciousness without a long wait. Totally worth it!",
    "The brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for $9.99 was a great deal. The barbecue was delicious and the sides, including potato casserole, creamed spinach, baked beans, and green beans, were wonderful. Affordable and satisfying!",
    "The food and service were amazing, but the lack of vegetarian/vegan options was disappointing. Can't wait to come back!",
    "Great food with terrible customer service. Experienced two different older waitresses in three visits, who were not pleasant to deal with. However, the owner was lovely.",
    "I discovered this breakfast spot thanks to a local's recommendation. They were right. No line, amazing food, and I'll definitely be going back when I'm in the south.",
    "Extremely disappointed with the unreliable and unprofessional service from this car detailing company. Despite confirming our appointment, they failed to keep their word and left us waiting for hours without any explanation or apology. Terrible experience overall.",
    "This office provided exceptional service during my move, going above and beyond to take care of me. The staff members are trustworthy and highly skilled. I had various complications, and they handled them flawlessly. I can't praise them enough and would recommend this office to anyone, even my own mother!",
    "The Saint had a lovely lobby, cool bar and restaurant, and friendly staff. However, our experience was ruined by a large roach in our room, small spiders, dead bugs, a broken TV, and missing bulbs in a lamp. The staff moved us to another room but could only fix the issues the next morning. We decided to leave and booked another hotel. The manager apologized and refunded our money, but we won't be returning.",
    "The Green Project is a great resource for affordable doors and a responsible destination for donating leftover building supplies.",
    "Terrible experience. Rude bouncer with unnecessary attitude. The establishment overcharges, assuming Broadway location excuses their mistreatment of patrons. Not a tourist, I live here and will never return or recommend.",
    "Stopped in for lunch with my girlfriend and were impressed by the spotless environment. The food was outstanding and reasonably priced. Can't wait for our next visit!",
    "This place used to be good, but now it's disappointing. The artichoke was poorly prepared, the Greek salad lacked flavor and was overdressed, and the grilled yellowtail was overcooked and of low quality. Despite the nice setting and good service, the subpar food makes it not worth visiting. They really need to improve their food quality.",
    "Milktooth is a popular brunch spot in Indy with a great breakfast cocktail selection and unique twists on traditional brunch dishes. Despite the wait, the experience is worth it. The menu is ever-changing, but the Dutch pancakes and raclette grilled cheese are exceptional. Don't forget to try the michelada, and if weather permits, sit outside.",
    "The bar and staff are amazing, offering great service. However, the room upgrade for our honeymoon did not match our expectations. The bathroom had rust and stains, while the rest of the room was comparable to a Hilton. Despite these issues, I still rate it 4 stars due to the exceptional staff. The valet parking was expensive, so we chose to park a few streets away. Overall, I recommend this hotel if you want to be in the lively downtown area of St. Louis, with numerous bars and restaurants to explore on a Friday night.",
    "The beginning class was absolutely fantastic! The perfect pace and simple moves managed to challenge me in unexpected ways, making me discover new muscles. I even broke a sweat! The studio is clean, and I appreciate the added bonus of being able to buy Beyond Organic food items there. Overall, I felt amazing after each class!",
    "Lobster Haven exceeded our expectations with its authentic New England seafood. Great service, fast and friendly, with a huge selection of favorites. A must-visit place for those craving genuine flavors, and they even offer live lobster and fresh seafood to take home and cook yourself.",
    "This place is fabulous! The best happy hour with a fresh menu and delicious drinks. Wish I could visit every day!",
    "Men's clubs is a top-notch barbershop where the skills of all the barbers ensure fresh haircuts. I've been a loyal customer for 3 years without any issues, except for one incident that was promptly resolved by Tim's honesty and professionalism.",
    "We are regulars here, and always enjoy the fresh food and excellent service. Highly recommended for sushi and hibachi lovers!",
    "Chickie's and Pete's is the perfect place to enjoy sports and indulge. The food is not the best, but the crab fries and mussels red are delicious. The atmosphere is great for game days and they have convenient sinks to clean up afterwards. It's a Philadelphia institution and worth experiencing at least once. Just be aware that during major sporting events, it can get crowded and rowdy with drunk people.",
    "Prompt and professional service on a Saturday. They made the simple mirror fix easy for me. Used them in Charlotte before and they were great then too.",
    "Union Station St. Louis is a good choice for dining. I enjoyed the Ponchartrain with its delicious mushroom and cream sauce. The shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake were decent appetizers, although not exceptional. The drinks and service were satisfactory. Dining on the outdoor patio was a great option due to the pleasant weather, but the interior also seemed comfortable and less casual.",
    "I stopped by for a drink yesterday and the atmosphere is exceptional, receiving an A+ from me. The remodel's attention to detail is outstanding, giving a Harry Potter-like ambiance. Background music is played at a low volume, perfect for conversation. Michael and Peggy, the bartenders, were friendly and fascinating to talk to. Although I didn't try the food, the prices for meat/cheese trays are better compared to other places in the area. I highly recommend checking this place out!",
    "Maple Street Patisserie is the bomb.com! Never disappointed. Best blueberry muffin ever. Delicious breakfast and lunch. Grab a king cake during Mardi Gras. Ziggy, the owner, is the man. Can't beat this place :)",
    "The Bourbon Black and Bleu burger was delicious and cooked to perfection. However, the lengthy wait time for our food, despite our large party, resulted in a rating of 3 stars.",
    "Katie's is our go-to place for out-of-town guests. The variety of deliciously prepared food is unmatched, and the prices are reasonable. Whether you choose the grilled oysters, shrimp and grits, Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup and salad, you'll be pleased with your meal. The daily specials highlight fresh, local seasonal offerings. The service staff is friendly and welcoming. Just make sure to arrive before church lets out on Sundays to avoid a wait, but you can enjoy bottomless mimosas while waiting.",
    "After attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament, I stumbled upon Creole Creamery. The interior is charming and cozy, perfect for a break from the warm and humid weather. The extensive selection of flavors is impressive, and I opted for the delicious cookie monster ice cream on a cone. It was just the right amount of sweetness. Highly recommend checking out Creole Creamery!",
    "I absolutely adore this place! I've been a loyal customer for years. It's a funky spot with a lively atmosphere, playing loud dance music that adds to the youthful vibe. Although I wouldn't risk trying the escargot for safety reasons, their extensive selection of Saki, fantastic rolls, and generous servings of rice and sashimi are definitely worth it. This is the perfect place to indulge in Saki and enjoy a great meal!",
    "We love everything we've tried here, especially the Backyard Bowl. The portion sizes are satisfying, even with the kids' size or splitting a large. Good quality ingredients at a reasonable price. Can get busy, but worth the wait.",
    "The service was average, with an interesting twist as the person was new. The food presentation was good, but the gumbo lacked rice or enough potato salad. The Sprite was flat, but it wasn't necessary for me.",
    "Good pancake place, can be disorganized during rush hours. Pancakes are delicious but overly sweet. Affordable prices and serves breakfast all day. Nothing too unique or exceptional.",
    "Fantastic finds and exceptional staff! Absolutely loved our experience and will definitely return for more!!",
    "This place holds a special place in my heart since I was a kid. The staff has become like family, providing friendly and prompt service. Yoli and Frank are incredible. The food is mind-blowing, especially their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. It's as authentic as it gets.",
    "Dine-in experience: 2 stars. Service and venue disappointed. \nTake-out potential: 3 stars. Decent food, but lacking.\nLamb kebab: Plain, only meat. Okay taste.",
    "The best Middle Eastern restaurant in this area! Great and consistent food, always makes my tummy happy!",
    "Potito's has the BEST cannoli in the city, far superior to Termini's and Isgro's. I highly recommend their cannoli over any other place. Trust me, it's worth it.",
    "El Limon is an exceptional, authentic and affordable Mexican eatery in Pennsylvania. The menu offers a wide variety of delicious dishes, including sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, and fish tacos. The waitstaff is friendly and attentive, and the standout features are their homemade tamales and complimentary margaritas. It's a must-visit restaurant for a memorable Mexican feast with the whole family. Ole!",
    "I'm giving this new joint 4 stars because they have some kinks to work out, but they have the potential to be 5-star material. Despite some errors due to being new, they are willing to make corrections and accommodations. The food is really good overall, except the pizza which is greasy and might not use 100% mozzarella. However, the Quaker, fries, onion rings, spanakopita, baklava, and signature salad are all delicious. The turkey Greek burger is one of the best I've had, though it had a few discrepancies from the menu. If they maintain their high quality standard, I'll definitely be returning.",
    "Planet Fitness gets four stars for its 24-hour availability and affordable price. However, it lacks motivation and caters more to big women rather than bodybuilders. The gym offers great amenities like tanning beds, massage chairs, and a sculpt machine for an additional fee. The staff is polite and helpful, but there are restrictions on bringing friends. Overall, a good value for the money.",
    "I was extremely disappointed with my experience. The restaurant claimed to be open until 5 PM on their website, but when we arrived at 2:15 PM on a Saturday, we were told that the kitchen had already closed. This lack of attention to important details like their operating hours raises concerns about their overall quality and attention to other important aspects.",
    "These guys are excellent - reliable, efficient, and guarantee their work. Highly recommended!",
    "Highly recommended! Friendly servers, amazing food, and always leaving satisfied with a full stomach. Eat here minimum twice a week.",
    "I found Carrow's Restaurant to be a truly delightful place, with its beautiful redwood beams and fascia. The food was fantastic, especially the tri-tip salad and tri-tip/chicken combo. The sides like fresh corn salad and potato salad were perfect. Dessert options like lemon meringue and apple pie were delicious, with reasonable prices. We've already recommended it to others and can't wait to go back. Well done!",
    "Rebecca was an amazing nanny for our first-born daughter and an invaluable source of knowledge and support during my second pregnancy. Her honest and truthful nature, coupled with her passion for being a doula, makes her a fantastic addition to any support team.",
    "I had a great experience with Orange Tint and Tune. Their car pick up service was convenient, and Carlos provided excellent customer care by going over tint options and adjusting to my preferences. The pleasant receptionist and follow-up call from the owner, Dustin, were nice touches. Deserves 5 stars.",
    "I stayed at this hotel for three nights on business and had a pleasant experience. Despite being close to the airport, there was minimal noise disturbance. The standard TownePlace Suite rooms were well-equipped with essential amenities. The location of the hotel is quiet, surrounded by other hotels and office buildings. It's conveniently located about a 20-minute drive from downtown and the university area, and only 5-10 minutes away from Pima Air Museum. While there aren't many restaurants nearby, there are fast food options and a delightful sandwich place called Baggins within walking distance. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast included standard continental options with a few hot dishes, and they also hosted a reception on weekday evenings. My only complaint is that the food and drink at the reception go quickly, so arriving early is recommended if you plan to have it as dinner. Although the area had food, there were very few soft drinks left (no diet) when I arrived 45 minutes after it started. It would be beneficial if they continuously restocked the area. However, overall, the rooms were nice, beds were comfortable, and the area felt safe.",
    "We got diverted to Tampa and decided to make the drive to Orlando. Yelp recommended this local gem and we were not disappointed. The wood-smoked steaks were amazing, with a smoky flavor that is hard to find elsewhere. Sides and wine selection were great too. The service from Lisa was excellent. Definitely coming back on future trips to Tampa!",
    "The owner's exceptional response to my previous review left a strong impression. After a great conversation, I revisited Saladworks twice, experiencing significantly improved service. The new summer salads are simply delightful. Recommended!",
    "This deli is hands down the best in the US! The menu is packed with incredible options, making it difficult to choose. The Muffalata is gigantic and delicious, perfect for sharing with a group. Also, the Saturday and Thursday live music nights add a fantastic touch. Don't miss out on the always tasty daily specials, and the variety of sides, including scrumptious chili, potato salad, and a wide selection of chips. Don't wait another minute, go to this deli now!",
    "Highly recommend the Saguaro National Park tour with Park Ranger Carolyn. Her enthusiasm, knowledge, and passion for studying the saguaro were exceptional. A must-do stop on our cross country trip.",
    "This place offers a wide range of flavors, from familiar to unique options. Their lemon pepper wings and New Orleans flavors like yaka mein and noonie bird are top-notch. The watermelon drink is incredible, although the location could be better. Still, they are putting effort into giving back to the community. It's safe during the day, but I wouldn't recommend coming alone at night. Overall, definitely worth a visit, you might even run into Skip.",
    "Tom Jones has made some improvements since my last visit. The odd ATM machine is no longer there, but there are now ATM's at the front entrance. The blue ribbon breakfast is still a great deal at $3.79, including a variety of items. The atmosphere is nostalgic with the orange booths and payphone. Service is fast and efficient with friendly waitresses. With my daughter loving this place, I am bumping up my rating from 4 to 5 stars.",
    "Dr. Ferrel is nothing short of a hero. As an amateur athlete, I first met him after a severe injury during a softball game. Despite my financial constraints as a single mom and teacher, Dr. Ferrel went above and beyond to provide treatment. When I initially sought a second opinion, I was told it would be months before I could play again. However, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel, who not only kept his promise but also healed me within weeks. Time and again, he has delivered remarkable results. Thanks to Dr. Ferrel, I am forever grateful and consider him my hero.",
    "The shows are always a blast! The atmosphere is entertaining and laid-back. Great food, great price. Highly recommended for a fun and enjoyable time.",
    "In-N-Out is simply irresistible. The crave for their mouthwatering burgers and indulgent animal style is undeniable. 4 patties all the way, my friends.",
    "Cindy's is outstanding with authentic food and great service. Freshly made dishes stand apart from others, and the staff adds to the genuine Mexican experience. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates tasty Mexican cuisine.",
    "I had high hopes for Trust Me BBQ, but the service and food left much to be desired. The lack of interaction and incorrect order made me feel like I was at a vending machine. The BBQ sauce was great and the macaroni salad was interesting, but the chicken was dry and the mac & cheese was not fresh. The collard greens lacked flavor. I'll be sticking with Down to the Bone BBQ from now on.",
    "Great find! The pa nang chicken was outstanding, especially at one star spicy. Quick service too. Will definitely come back!",
    "This place is a hidden gem for Cinco de Mayo enthusiasts. With a diverse menu combining flavors from various cuisines, they create unique and tantalizing recipes. Despite not being specifically Mexican, they excel at margaritas and tequila. The newly opened wine bar next door is perfect for overflow and specialty bottles. The on the rocks margaritas and house-made sangria are outstanding. A must-visit destination!",
    "This small donut bakery in Hermitage's oldest shopping center offers a delectable variety of treats, including unique options like bacon-topped donuts and doughssants, a delightful fusion of donuts and croissants. With affordable prices, such as $1.99 for a doughssant, it's worth a visit just for this one-of-a-kind pastry. The sweet donuts also make excellent gifts for teachers, and the bakery serves coffee as well.",
    "We've had a fantastic time at all the events we've attended, from concerts to basketball games. The food options were also impressive, featuring delicious local favorites.",
    "The food was excellent! We loved the three appetizers and five entrees we tried - they were all a hit. Reasonable prices and good service. I would definitely go back again and again.",
    "The service declined significantly, prompting us to switch to another establishment. Slow and neglectful service was the primary issue.",
    "This chicken and rice plate was a major disappointment. Despite specifically requesting no sauce, the dish arrived drenched in oil, completely contradicting what I was promised. The excessive amount of oil made it unappetizing and far from healthy. The restaurant's claim to promote a healthy image is simply a joke. Overall, a horrible experience.",
    "I had a great experience purchasing a washer and dryer from Sears. Despite the negative reviews, I had no issues at all. The selection was excellent, the salespeople were knowledgeable, and the delivery was on time. The level of service exceeded my expectations, with the staff going above and beyond to give me the best price within my budget. They even checked for additional discounts. I received honest feedback and all my questions were answered. Highly recommend Sears!",
    "The food is excellent, service is fast, and the staff is incredibly friendly. Always a pleasant experience ordering here.",
    "Finally had the chance to try them and was absolutely blown away by their remodel. The mushroom cheese steak was simply sensational.",
    "The espresso is top-notch, making it my go-to spot for an Americano. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed. Worth noting, there are no power outlets, but WiFi is available. Clean and well-maintained facilities overall.",
    "Overall, the experience at this restaurant was underwhelming. The website lacked clear menu descriptions and prices, and the table placecard was more informative. The bar-like atmosphere wasn't an issue, but the temperature difference between the roast beef and roast pork sandwiches was disappointing. The sandwiches were also lacking in meat, compensating with excessive gravy that made the bread soggy. Opting for the \"wet meat\" option would have been a better choice to maintain the sandwich's integrity.",
    "Great takeout experience from Village Whiskey! Despite the pricy Whiskey Burger at $26, it's absolutely worth it if you enjoy a greasier burger. It's super tender with awesome bacon, and a generous portion size. Highly recommend if you don't mind the price. The Duck Fat fries are also rich and delicious.",
    "Recently, I decided to spend $80 on food for my family and it was definitely worth it. The food was served hot, and the orange chicken was one of the best I've tasted in a while. From now on, this will be our go-to place for Asian food!",
    "I found this laundromat to be safe, clean, and well-equipped with friendly staff. The laundry and dryer worked efficiently, allowing me to complete several oversize loads in just under 2 hours. The facility has security cameras, amenities like flat screen T.V's and wi-fi, and a pleasant atmosphere. Overall, a wonderful place to do laundry. Thank you, LAUNDROMAT!",
    "The prices are high, and we decided to split a plate, which annoyed the server. The food was good but not worth the price. The garlic bread was amazing though. Probably wouldn't eat there again with so much competition in St Louis.",
    "Stopped by the Haven during the Seahawks/Saints game and it was packed for a reason - the Haven burger I had was fantastic. Despite the bustling crowd, I'll be returning, perhaps for a less busy lunch on a Tuesday.",
    "I've only tried their vermicelli bowls, but they are reasonably priced, a good size, and consistently prepared. Located conveniently for Alberta Ave residents, my orders have always been ready within 15 minutes, even during busy times like Friday nights.",
    "I had a disappointing experience at this restaurant. The Chicken Marsala was thin, tough, and dry, while the pasta was undercooked and clumped together. Both dishes lacked flavor. The lasagne had a thin layer of pasta and lacked taste as well. Additionally, the staff cleared my friend's plate while she was away and had to bring her a new meal in a doggie bag. On the positive side, the atmosphere was great with live music, and I enjoyed dancing with my husband. However, the food was overpriced for its poor quality.",
    "This place is a hidden gem with a fantastic location and ample street parking. The BYOB policy adds to the charm. I have visited twice and every dish I tried was enjoyable, especially the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads/pickles, and chai. The chocolate cake was a crowd pleaser and can be shared. Conveniently, there is a corner bar that offers takeout beer. Needless to say, I will definitely be returning.",
    "This restaurant is my absolute favorite! The ceviche is pure perfection. The atmosphere exudes fun and the service, led by Alex, is top-notch - friendly, attentive, and thoughtful.",
    "I absolutely love this store! The fresh salad bar and a wide range of ethnic food options make it a must-visit. N-JOY!",
    "Excellent Mediterranean chicken shawarma: flavorful and generous portions of chicken in the pita. The food was prepared and ready to go upon arrival, providing good service. Will definitely revisit when in the area again.",
    "I highly recommend this place to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The food is delicious, the space is pleasant, and the staff is very welcoming.",
    "Although it took some time to be attended to, the service eventually met expectations. The gumbo was exceptional, and I highly enjoyed the chicken and waffles. The staff was friendly, and the location on Bourbon Street provided great opportunities for people watching.",
    "Earl at the airport offers a decent selection of sandwiches, including turkey, tuna, and Hawaiian. I opted for the roast beef sandwich and it did not disappoint. The sliced beef was cooked perfectly and paired well with cheddar cheese and a delicious horseradish sauce. The sandwich is best enjoyed without lettuce or tomatoes. Conveniently located near the security station and Delta SkyClub, it's easy to grab and enjoy at the gate or onboard.",
    "This place is incredible! The food was outstanding, especially the cheese curds with red pepper jelly. The fish tacos and beer brat were both delicious and came in generous portions. The service was top-notch, with an attentive and knowledgeable server who made us feel welcome. The manager even checked in with us and mentioned their great deals on game days and brunch on weekends. The staff bid us farewell and gave us a sweet parting gift. I can't wait to come back!",
    "I had a great experience at this restaurant! The burger was delicious and made me rethink ordering burgers when eating out. The beer selection was decent and the staff made me feel welcomed. The food was prepared as ordered and served quickly. The atmosphere was nice and the restrooms were clean. Overall, I left very happy with my visit.",
    "The hotel is too big, expensive, and far from Downtown. The meals are overpriced and there are limited options nearby. Getting the car from valet and going to restaurants off the property is time-consuming. However, the property itself is gorgeous, and the room was spacious and well-equipped. There was an issue with the billing and the check-out process was a nightmare. Despite potential future conferences, the reviewer is not looking forward to returning.",
    "I had a mostly enjoyable experience at Ava. The Ricotta cheese & toasted bread appetizer had great flavor, but the bread to cheese ratio was off. Both pizzas, sausage and potato with rosemary, were tasty, though they seemed to forget the Rosemary on ours. The grouper w/Israeli couscous entree was scrumptious. The zeppoles for dessert were amazing, but the cherry tart was not my personal favorite, although others at my table enjoyed it. I'll be returning to try their homemade pastas next time as they looked great.",
    "First time eating here and it was a fantastic experience. The restaurant is very clean with friendly staff. The sushi was incredibly fresh and reasonably priced. The service was impeccable. Will definitely be returning in the future.",
    "This place is simply the best. The name says it all. If you're not a fan of chicken, then this isn't the place for you. Their chicken is exceptional! Also, make sure to try their delicious fried corn on the cob. It's amazing!",
    "Unfortunately, the food at this place is really below average. It was similar to a Waffle House experience. Despite the positive reviews, the pancakes tasted like frozen processed ones and the \"homemade\" maple syrup was watery and artificially flavored. The hash browns were greasy and lacking in taste, while the bacon was overcooked and hard to chew. It was clear that the food had been sitting for a while. Overall, the lack of inspiration in the dishes was disappointing. This restaurant seems to rely on an outdated reputation and there are definitely better options available in Nashville.",
    "Overall, the dining experience at this place was excellent. We opted for the budget-friendly prix fixe menu for lunch. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the prime rib po'boy with tomato fennel soup, while I relished the seafood jamabalaya and seafood gumbo - both of which were outstanding, surpassing any I've tasted before. The upscale interpretation of the po'boy, with gruyere and horseradish sauce, was a standout.",
    "I highly recommend Pure Design for large events. Their staff was professional, offered unique and beautiful arrangements within my budget, and created a gorgeous space that our guests raved about. I was also able to take home/give away the arrangements, which lasted several days after the event.",
    "My husband and I, being older, thoroughly enjoyed our time at this Par-Tee. The friendly server made us feel welcome and was knowledgeable about the drinks. The beer and liquor selection impressed us, and we were pleasantly surprised by the small but excellent bar food menu. The pork belly sliders were a standout, and we highly recommend them. We hope they add more delicious tapas in the future. The staff was engaging and we will definitely be returning.",
    "Average food with high prices and disappointing portion sizes. The bison burger was the only highlight, but it was overpriced and ruined with unnecessary toppings. Overall, not worth the money and won't be returning.",
    "The service provided by our server, LaToya, was excellent. However, the black bean burger was dry, and the sweet potato fries were good. Unfortunately, the handling of an arrest in the restaurant was disturbing and poorly managed, causing discomfort to customers and staff. The managers were unavailable and did not address the situation. This lack of care for customers and staff is unacceptable.",
    "The sliders at this place are fantastic! Perfect size allows you to try more than one, and the fried chicken slider, BLT slider, monte cristo, and Cuban were all delicious. Now it's time to get some donuts to go!",
    "We recently visited this restaurant for the third time since its reopening. They have daily specials, offering a plate with ice-tea and soup at a reasonable price of $7.95. Today's special included Carne Asada with rice n beans, a fried fish plate, and 2 chicken enchiladas with rice n beans, all accompanied by tea n soup. We both opted for the Carne Asada plate, and they kindly let me substitute my rice n beans for a salad. The steak was enjoyable, and overall, the food was good. Additionally, the service was attentive.",
    "Love this little shop for its inviting aroma, extensive spice selection, and knowledgeable staff. Their products last a long time and taste fresher than alternatives. Prices are reasonable, making it worth the investment.",
    "Steve and his partner are absolutely amazing! Their offer to demo a variety of racquets is unbeatable. The prices are fantastic and there is an extensive selection to choose from. If you're a player, this is the place to be!",
    "Despite the higher-than-expected crowd, the staff at Chick-fil-A in Reno was amazing. Despite waiting in line for 8 minutes, we got our food within 5 minutes of finding a table. The restaurant ran smoothly despite the large number of people. Although one sandwich was messed up, the issue was promptly resolved. The staff was attentive, going around to ask for refills and feedback on the food. Overall, we're glad to have a Chick-fil-A in Reno, as they maintained their high standards even on opening day.",
    "experience overall and would definitely recommend it to others.",
    "Beck's is a bit expensive for the portion sizes, but their gator gumbo is absolutely amazing. Savory, perfectly spiced, and not too spicy or salty. The gator is chopped up and served in sausage form in the gumbo. However, the pasta, specifically the chicken alfredo, was dry and not worth ordering again. Overall, go for the gator gumbo and skip the pasta.",
    "Despite being initially concerned by the reviews, my experience was excellent. There was a minimal wait time, and the staff was welcoming and helpful from the moment I entered the lobby to interacting with the office staff.",
    "Unfortunately, The Taint failed to live up to its hype. The apathetic atmosphere and unsavory crowd in the Garden District left me unimpressed. Not my scene.",
    "Just discovered a new Chick-fil-A location in Bloomingdale and had a great experience! Despite a busy parking lot, the staff efficiently managed the drive-thru lanes. Every employee I interacted with was friendly and welcoming. The food was tasty, although the fries could have been cooked longer. Overall, a good addition to the area. Welcome to Bloomingdale, Chick-fil-A!",
    "I found this cute spot on Germantown Ave and they didn't disappoint when it came to satisfying my sweet tooth. They had a wide selection of cookies and bars, and I was intrigued by their \"cake scrapple\" cups filled with different flavors of cakes and icings. I chose the Red Velvet with cream cheese frosting, along with an M&M cookie. The cookie was soft, chewy, and had a nice texture from the hard candies. The cake was also delicious and moist. Overall, a delightful experience.",
    "This place has seen many improvements, creating a much more comfortable environment now. The only minor downside is the chairs, which could be more comfortable for watching a whole football game. Overall, significant improvements have been made and it's a much better place now.",
    "Good food, but slow service. They need more staff at the counter to take orders.",
    "I visited this place early on, but was disappointed with only one flavor option, which was not enjoyable. Additionally, everything was costly, and our meal for three left us unsatisfied. The sauce did not resemble Cajun style but rather a combination of buffet sauces with fish sauce. Overall, I rate them a solid three since there are better dining options available.",
    "We had a fantastic time on this Ybor walking tour with great food stops! Our knowledgeable guide, Raymond, made it an informative and enjoyable experience. The tour lasted about 3 hours, but we went over because we got sidetracked and chatted a lot. We learned fascinating details about the history, culture, and people of Ybor. The food tastings were delicious, especially the Cuban sandwich at Stone Soup Company. Whether you're a visitor or a long-time resident, I highly recommend this fun adventure. Plus, we walked over 5000 steps, which helps offset the calories from all the delicious food!",
    "Franzone's never disappoints with their delicious sweet spiral plain pies. I highly recommend trying their white pizza with onions too - a delightful surprise! It's the same great quality I remember from the Bridgeport location I grew up with.",
    "Avoid this clinic at all costs. They misdiagnosed my daughter's severe sore throat as a fungal infection and prescribed medication that made it worse. Despite being the only patients, the staff was robotic and unfriendly. We were rushed out the door and not allowed to ask questions. Overall, a very unfriendly experience. It's better to have a primary care physician than rely on these clinics.",
    "The chicken sandwich was absolutely amazing, making it a fantastic choice for the surrounding industrial atmosphere.",
    "Setting up the appointment online was effortless and hassle-free. Our guided 2-hour side by side ride with Matt was fantastic. He was incredibly knowledgeable and made the experience even more enjoyable. We were treated to breathtaking views throughout the ride. Overall, we had a great time with superb service.",
    "The bar offers a great happy hour from 4-7 every day with $3 wine and drafts, $5 pizza, and $4.50 appetizers. The to-go dinners and lunches are reasonably priced and served quickly. The staff is incredibly friendly.",
    "Terrible experience - found hair in both appetizer and friend's noodles. Waiter was good, but no effort made to rectify the situation. Won't return.",
    "ITV is a dream-like dining experience with a beautiful ambiance and attentive staff. The three-dollar beef fat biscuit was the standout dish that impressed me the most. The menu features delectable options like Foie with Apricot Miso, Pork Cheeks, and trout pumpernickel soldiers. The cocktails, especially the ouroboros, were exceptional. The bar menu also offers unique cold-smoked items. I highly recommend this terrific place and regret not writing this review sooner. Head to East Passyunk for some of the best this city has to offer!",
    "I adore this place! Exceptional hours, spotlessly clean, incredibly relaxing.",
    "Buckingham Pizza delivers the best pizza in town, especially their plain and speciality pizzas like the cool ranch. Stick with their pizzas and maybe some sides, as their entrees like the chicken piccata are just good.",
    "Cafe Beignet has the best iced latte and beignet we've tried, along with live music that adds to the great atmosphere. Compared to Cafe du Monde, we prefer Cafe Beignet for its superior quality and service. Plus, the lack of long lines is a bonus.",
    "Captain Bill's offers a fun and relaxed atmosphere with a great view of the water. The menu caters to a diverse range of tastes and even accommodates ingredient substitutions. The food is served hot, fresh, and exactly as requested. The wait service is excellent and the wait time is minimal. We left the restaurant satisfied and looking forward to our next visit. Highly recommended for a pleasant dining experience.",
    "The sushi at this restaurant is excellent, with the peanut avocado roll being a standout. The Volcano roll was also amazing. The service was friendly and the overall experience was great. Despite the distance, I will definitely be returning. Highly recommended if you're in Valrico.",
    "This Cuban restaurant is decent but average. It's convenient for me to grab lunch at, and their daily specials are worth trying as they are always freshly made.",
    "The 6 oz pepperloin meal pleased my husband, though the shrimp kabob meal was disappointing with only 4 overcooked and small shrimp. Nevertheless, service was good and the restaurant was not busy.",
    "I had a rushed experience but the wait was worth it. The locals were welcoming and patient with newcomers. The smell upon entering was appetizing and the pastrami sandwich was the best I've ever had. The interior was filled with captivating bottle cap decor. The service was exceptional, as they knew exactly what the customers wanted.",
    "Heather's new shop is a dream come true. She is an amazing color wizard, always crafting looks with flair and creativity. The shop has a relaxed and comfortable vibe. I trust Heather and her staff completely, and I love recommending her to friends and family. Plus, the shop's location in the heart of E. Passyunk is perfect. Don't forget to ask Heather for cactus houseplant tips or chat about vintage bikes when you visit!",
    "Sally's offers a great variety of hair supplies, making it my go-to store for experimenting. The staff is friendly and products are usually well-stocked. However, I wish they had more knowledge about their products and the store appeared bigger, brighter, and cleaner. Overall, I'm satisfied with Sally's.",
    "I have been going to the same hair stylist in Austin for seven years, but when I couldn't visit him, I decided to try Rodney Mitchell's Salon. Despite not seeing my preferred stylist, Allison did an amazing job with my haircut. She was friendly, not too chatty, and understood exactly what I wanted. The discount for first-time visitors and referrals is a great perk too. I can't wait to go back!",
    "Great location, spacious, and friendly baristas. However, the constant and loud music ruins the coffee shop experience. Also, tea drinkers will be disappointed with the ungainly filters used. Gluten free options and tasty Italian sodas are a plus. Overall, would love to stay longer but the music drives me out within 10 minutes.",
    "Spice n Grill in St. Louis offers the best Indian food with perfectly spiced beef nihari, palak paneer, and naan. The dishes were adequately spicy and crave-worthy. Despite limited seating, the friendly owner makes up for it. If you're in the mood for delicious take-out, I highly recommend this restaurant.",
    "Overall, the reviewer had mixed feelings about the boba place. They were disappointed that the boba didn't have the same feel as in California and found some flavors to be lacking in real fruit taste. However, if one doesn't mind powdered flavors, the place could be enjoyable. The reviewer recommends trying boba and grass jelly. It's a good place for hanging out and doing activities. The reviewer feels that it could be better but acknowledges their own pickiness.",
    "I've been ordering from Silver Mine's for 4-5 years now, but they have gotten progressively worse. They charge for additions to your soup or chili but don't include them in the order. They also forget free sides like bread. Delivery takes at least an hour, unlike Jimmy Johns. With better options available, this business is in trouble. Service is worse than if kindergarteners ran it. Embarrassing and a waste of space. Will never order from here again.",
    "I recently had a great experience at this bike shop. Brought my damaged bike in for a quick fix on the front basket and a safety check. They not only repaired the basket and gear shifter for free, but they also had it ready in less than 30 minutes. The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming. So glad I found this shop.",
    "The store is like Disneyland for adults - I love it! Prices may be a bit high, but I still enjoy going just to look around.",
    "Pag's in Doylestown offers an underrated cheeseburger that is simply fantastic. Despite a less appealing menu, the cheeseburger was one of the best I've had in a while, comparable to a quality Big Mac. The patty wasn't too thick, and the bun perfectly complemented the burger without overpowering it. The sauce used was absolutely delicious. Although not very kid friendly in the wine bar section, the ambiance is great and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be returning to Pag's when I'm in the mood for a good burger.",
    "Fantastic food, excellent service! My boyfriend and I frequent this place for lunch/dinner every two weeks. Reasonable prices and mouthwatering dishes like Indian Pancake, Hainanese Chicken, and Curry Chicken. Weekends can get busy, but waiting is never an issue for us. Highly recommended, we never tire of it!",
    "The service at this highly-rated diner in a tourist area was disappointing, with slow service and unfriendly waitresses. The presence of trash on the outside deck, which could potentially end up in the ocean, was a major concern. The food was good, but the lack of responsibility and poor service means I won't be returning.",
    "I recently tried their pre fixe meal for $22 and loved the combination of flavors on my plate. The chicken was moist and the vegetables were tasty, although slightly greasy. Overall, it was a great dining experience. \n\nTheir take out/delivery service is also a favorite of mine. I appreciate how they package their food in reusable plastic containers, avoiding excessive waste. The food may not be exceptional, but it is consistently enjoyable. Although the prices are a bit high, the contemporary restaurant atmosphere, excellent service, and dependable food make it a reliable choice.",
    "This Chinese place offers typical dishes and a familiar menu. However, it stands out with its great lunch specials, and the convenience of food being ready for pickup is a definite plus.",
    "Finally got to try this place last night. Eclectic menu for foodies. The onion tart and veal meatballs with polenta were delicious. The red gravy tasted homemade. The citrus short ribs with fat noodles and brussel sprouts were amazing, couldn't finish it all. Small and crowded, but a great friendly atmosphere. Will definitely be back to try more interesting dishes.",
    "We had a fantastic dining experience at Angelina's, a small Italian restaurant in South Philly. After being unable to get into the oldest Italian restaurant, we stumbled upon Angelina's and immediately felt at home. The eggplant and roasted pepper appetizer was delicious and the Veal Osso Bocca, Carbonara, and lasagna were absolutely amazing. We can't wait to go back!",
    "The food and view were exceptional, especially the lobster mac and cheese.",
    "Superb ice cream store with delicious and generously portioned servings. Pleasingly unique flavors set it apart. A must-visit spot that sets the bar high for others to follow.",
    "The food is average, but the drink specials are great. Unfortunately, the place is rarely crowded and lacks atmosphere. Last time I went on a Friday night at 10 pm, there were only three other parties at the bar. Additionally, they announced last call just 5 minutes after ordering our first drink, which was disappointing. As a result, we have decided to remove it from our list of options for evening drinks.",
    "When it's late and you're craving munchies, this is the perfect place to order from.",
    "Value City may not live up to its name as a cheap value retailer. The store offers furniture prices comparable to Rothman but with Ashley Furniture quality. However, the selection for entertainment centers and TV stands is limited and overpriced. Their \"Clearance\" section is disappointing, with minimal discounts. Sectionals are expensive for unfamiliar brands, and staff prioritizes chatting over customer service. The dining sets are average and overpriced, available elsewhere for less. A 5% military discount fails to make a significant impact. On the positive side, they do have a few modern pieces. Overall, it's better to shop around or wait for a holiday sale for better deals on low to mediocre quality furniture.",
    "I highly recommend Franzone's. The owner is always present, incredibly friendly, and genuinely invested in the quality of the food. Their sweet sauce isn't my personal preference, but they also serve a decent cheesesteak, fries, and more. The exceptional experience I have every time I visit pushes their rating up to a solid 4 out of 5 for me.",
    "Bab Cafe is a must-visit Asian restaurant in Reno, offering incredible flavor and a sauce bar to mix things up. The friendly and knowledgeable staff make ordering a breeze. The Jeyuk Top-Bab (spicy pork) is a must-try dish with unbeatable taste. The included miso soup and convenient downtown location add to the great value. Whether taking away, dining in, or getting it delivered, Bab Cafe is a fantastic culinary experience.",
    "If you're not a seafood fan, this place will change your mind. The $15 lunch special, a seafood stew with oyster meat, crab claws, shrimp, and redfish, was absolutely amazing. Even though I wasn't hungry, I devoured the whole thing without thinking. The spice, consistency, and tenderness of the meat were perfect. Definitely worth a visit.",
    "Biscuit Love is totally worth the wait, despite the heat! I enjoyed the Vegan grits with a biscuit on the side, and it was amazing. Even my three sisters loved their choices. The service was excellent, considering the wait was 45 minutes. The line moved quickly, and our food arrived promptly. Biscuit Love has their process perfected! Thanks for a delicious breakfast!",
    "Ichicoro Ane gets it right with its perfect combination of ambiance, food choices, and whiskey selection. The servers have been helpful and pleasant, making the experience even better. The katsu is a must-try for those seeking a filling dish, while the bao buns are perfect for a lighter option. The portion sizes vary, so be sure to ask your server. The cocktail selection is excellent, especially the Japanese Old Fashioned, although slightly pricey. Exploring the menu little by little is a delightful experience, best enjoyed in a group setting that reminds me of Japanese pubs.",
    "This bakery is amazing! Their breakfast sandwiches, coffee, and donuts are top-notch. My friend and I always look forward to our weekend mornings here.",
    "I highly recommend this place for its extensive whiskey/bourbon selection that caters to all preferences. The burger with fried egg was absolutely delicious and probably one of the best I've ever had. Don't miss out on the must-try duck fries. The atmosphere is cute, but seating arrangements for larger parties can be a bit awkward, hindering conversations. Nonetheless, it's a nice place to visit and we definitely plan on going back.",
    "The pub offers a delightful English ambiance, creating a cozy atmosphere. The skillful bartenders take pride in crafting great drinks. However, be prepared for high prices, as a standard mixed drink costs $7. Additionally, bear in mind that seating is limited.",
    "Cozy atmosphere with tasty drinks served in pretty glasses, reminiscent of grandmother's china cabinet. Limited drink choices mainly featuring ginger, lime, and honey combinations. Bacon wrapped dates were overly sweet, difficult to enjoy. Noise level escalated as more people entered, surprising considering the fabric in the room. Friendly servers, although second drink not offered when glass was taken away.",
    "This place consistently exceeds expectations, providing a wonderful experience year after year. Hayrides, pumpkin picking, and an array of activities never disappoint.",
    "Received poor service when inquiring about warranty work for my 2015 $110K AMG. Was informed that I would have to pay for a loaner car since I didn't buy the vehicle from their dealership. Will not be returning.",
    "This place is like a mini Whole Foods with a salad bar, fresh fruits, and a juice bar. It's a fantastic little grocery store and the only one of its kind in the city. They even have a parking lot. Conveniently located just a few blocks away from clothing stores, it's great for a quick walk.",
    "I adore this place. Wonderful outdoor ambiance, unbeatable unique wine selection, and incredible live music even on a weekday. Satisfying experience with exquisite cheeses and artistic menu. Beautiful ambiance for all senses.",
    "I highly recommend this place for smog tests on cars due to their excellent service and cheerful staff.",
    "This place is outstanding with an excellent selection of gluten-free and vegan options. The salad, pizza, and root beer were simply perfect.",
    "We had an amazing experience at this clean and inviting restaurant! All six of us enjoyed delicious burgers and left thoroughly satisfied. Don't miss out on their must-try sweet potato tots.",
    "This establishment is a great choice for a relaxed dining experience. The food is good but not exceptional, scoring a solid 7.8 out of 10. The lighting is perfect, and the noise level is pleasantly low, making for a comfortable ambiance (10 out of 10 for both). The environment is nice and tidy, earning an 8.5 rating. Moreover, the staff is friendly and attentive, with a rating of 9 out of 10.",
    "I highly recommend this convenience store deli for its delicious sandwiches and beautiful waterfront seating. Despite the lack of restaurant ambiance and drink service, I am extremely satisfied with the quality of food. Hands down, this deli beats the more popular breakfast place nearby in terms of taste. 4 stars!",
    "My second experience here was even better than the first. Despite some initial kinks during the grand opening, this time they had multiple beer bottle openers and improved the portion size of the garlic noodle. Although certain tables still seemed drafty, we were seated at a better table and it didn't bother me. The food was amazing as always, and I'm already excited for my next visit. Even on a Saturday evening at 5pm, we had no trouble getting seated. I'm so glad to have these guys in our local neighborhood. Highly recommended!",
    "I used to love Skyline Chili but unfortunately, the Clearwater location is not up to par. Poor service, slow food service, and frequently out of ingredients or equipment issues. The cheese coney hot dogs are still delicious though. Hoping they improve soon.",
    "The eyebrow waxing here is fantastic, but the lack of availability and slow response time for appointments bring my rating down to 2 stars. I recommend booking weeks in advance if you want to be seen. Ultimately, I've switched to another place despite the higher cost, as it offers more flexibility and availability.",
    "The taco's, nacho's, atmosphere, and margarita's at this place are amazing! Plus, they have a triple special day on Wednesdays. Perfect spot for some delicious Mexican food and drinks.",
    "The rental service had insufficient staff, resulting in long wait times and a delay in car preparation. The car was not properly cleaned and the customer was charged an expensive underage fee despite being close to the required age. They recommend choosing a different rental company like Hertz to avoid such issues. The fuel option was also misleading, with prices after tax being similar to those outside, and the return location address provided was incorrect, causing further inconvenience.",
    "Thank you, Yelp reviewers! Todd and Roberta did an outstanding job at my house. My carpet and couch look amazing, with all the pet accident spots gone. The fresh smell without any chemicals or wetness is impressive. Additionally, they were incredibly friendly and offered valuable home care advice. Definitely worth every penny and highly recommended for future services!",
    "I absolutely love this place! The sips mocha is my favorite, and the staff is always friendly. The drive-thru option is a lifesaver with kids, and their cakes are simply amazing.",
    "Chateau La Vin has been my favorite for years, and it's amazing to see how it has evolved from a wine store to a fantastic wine bar. With an extensive wine selection, cheese and crackers, and even the option to order from local restaurants, it offers a delightful experience. The owner's knowledge and willingness to share make the visit even more enjoyable. They also cater to beer drinkers with a nice variety. Outdoor seating is available too. Overall, Chateau La Vin is a fantastic place to visit.",
    "The Hollander Hotel provided an unforgettable experience for our wedding. The charming property, beautiful lobby decor, and spacious Tap Room created the perfect atmosphere. The rooms were clean and cozy, with great prices and a convenient shuttle. The brunch was delicious and reasonably priced, with friendly staff and a lovely patio. Most importantly, the management and team at the Hollander were exceptional, treating us like family and ensuring every guest had a wonderful experience. Highly recommended!",
    "I had the gyro platter for lunch and it was disappointing. The dish was dry, uninspired, and not at all like a deconstructed gyro. The included vegetables resembled poop, both in appearance and taste. Fairmount has better lunch options that don't serve unappetizing dishes.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this place. The atmosphere was pleasant, and it was a treat to have the brewery on-site. The drinks were great, and the waiter was both knowledgeable and kind.",
    "Highly recommended New Orleans restaurant with amazing ambience, fantastic service, and must-try signature dishes like BBQ shrimp and bread pudding. Fried green tomato appetizer is a perfect start to a memorable dining experience.",
    "This store has an amazing variety of products and exceptional customer service. It's a shame they don't have a branch in Ft. McMurray.",
    "This tanning salon's customer service was extremely disappointing, as they attempted to deceive and take advantage of customers. Despite the online coupon offering unlimited tanning for $15, they claimed it was only for students without any mention on the coupon itself. They also falsely stated that the coupon had expired, even though it was still available on Yelp and their website. Furthermore, they refused to honor another discounted coupon available for purchase on Yelp. The conflicting information provided by staff members and lack of consistency between locations was frustrating. Overall, it is advisable to avoid this place.",
    "Impressive place! Incredible food, efficient chipotle-style line ordering, and top-notch Indian cuisine. The staff were extremely helpful, especially for someone new to Indian food. Can't wait to go back!",
    "El Sabor Poblano on Federal is an unassuming Mexican place that is worth a visit. They offer delicious fish tacos with generous portions of flakey fish, and their chorizo tacos are crispy and gristle-free. The staff is accommodating and the prices are reasonable.",
    "I finally visited this spot I've always wanted to go to. Despite the ongoing police investigation regarding a recent burglary, the bartender provided excellent service and my pint of dark ale was cold and refreshing. The wings were also delicious. I appreciated the friendly owners whom I met at a local festival and will definitely be a regular patron. This non-franchised establishment has a great atmosphere and I highly recommend it to fellow Yelpers.",
    "Found this place on Yelp and the reviews were spot on. The sandwiches are delicious, and despite the wait in line, the fast and friendly service made it worth it. We ordered four different sandwiches, filled up our sodas, and in no time, our food was delivered to our table. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.",
    "Great theater recliners, but beware of limited aisle space. Enjoyable lounge experience with a delightful bartender. Drinking in the theater is a bonus. However, concessions were disappointing with slow service and burnt popcorn. Consider eating beforehand and sticking to the bar next time.",
    "This hotel is top-notch! Immaculate, friendly staff, impressive pool, and a stunning entrance. Already counting down the days until my return next year.",
    "I visited this place when it first opened and was highly disappointed with the quality and taste of the food. I have no desire to return and I strongly advise against dining here.",
    "Visited on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Limited food options, but average beer selection. None of the styles stood out. Unfortunate staff conflict was audible and dampened the experience. Although it had a cool location, better alternatives nearby might be preferred.",
    "I was disappointed with Tony Luke's at terminal F. The Philly Cheese Steak didn't resemble the picture and the meat tasted unpleasant, like dog food. Not worth the $10.",
    "I absolutely love this hidden gem in Creve Couer! The 9-hole course is both enjoyable and affordable. The staff is extremely helpful as well.",
    "First time visit. Slow service, poor attitude from employees. Good food.",
    "The food at this dive bar is consistently delicious, however, the service is lacking.",
    "The museum offers an incredible collection for free, with beautiful exhibits that include African and Modern Art. The outdoor sculpture garden and gift shop were also impressive. Highly recommended, but remember no photography in the Modern Art section!",
    "The restaurant's size may give the impression that it's great for groups, but my experience with 9 people on a Saturday morning was a long and exhausting wait for a table. They don't accept reservations, and we were too small to be accommodated in a meeting room. The manager offered to fill coffee cups while we waited, but it would have been better if they just refilled the pot for everyone waiting. The food, however, was good. The 1/2 and 1/2 combos are a great option, and I enjoyed my turkey Reuben and salad, although I was charged extra for sauerkraut which was not plentiful. My friend had the sunrise chile rellenos and I would consider ordering it if I returned with a smaller group.",
    "The Shop is an exceptional space with meticulous attention to detail and unparalleled services. It offers ample options for private meetings and productive work.",
    "Had a delightful anniversary dinner here! The food was melt-in-your-mouth amazing and the customer service was top-notch. Will definitely return!",
    "The Terrace Lounge falls short as a cocktail venue. The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquor selection throughout Peppermill is disappointing. The service is inconsistent with overwhelmed bartenders and no designated bar areas. The atmosphere is affected by the presence of typical casino gamblers, some of whom are inconsiderate smokers. Cin Cin is a better choice with excellent cocktails and no machines at the bar. Peppermill should improve by removing the machines, training staff, and offering independent liquors.",
    "5-star review: \n\nCan't say enough good things about the awesome service at this place! Shoutout to Amanda, the resident comedian, who made our experience even more enjoyable. The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive. The food is delicious and the beer is served icy cold. Highly recommend!",
    "This is my go-to nail shop in the city. The peaceful ambiance is perfect, and the staff is always friendly and efficient. Plus, at just $25.00 for a pedicure in the South, it's unbeatable!",
    "I had a fantastic breakfast at this NJ diner! The egg sandwich was delicious, especially with the top-notch hamburger roll and generous cheese. The home fries were sauteed with peppers and onions and had great flavor. The pancakes were fluffy, although the syrup could've been better. The server was friendly and attentive, and the coffee was surprisingly good. I can't wait to return!",
    "The server was excellent, very attentive and friendly. The maple wings were delicious. However, the paid performance by the \"piano guys\" was highly inappropriate and offensive, crossing all limits of decency. It completely ruined the experience and we left immediately. Moreover, for the price paid, we only heard a fraction of one song.",
    "I prefer the new Han Dynasty branch over the one in Olde City due to the exceptional service and attentive staff. Although the specialties differ between locations, the food is satisfactory, although not as spicy as the other branch. The layout and atmosphere are more appealing, and they offer smaller lunch portions at a discounted price, making it a great option for lunch alone or in a small group.",
    "Carisma Restaurante is our go-to spot for its excellent food and great service. The owner, Jose, ensures everyone is satisfied and the dishes, including paellas, salmon, and filet mignon, are cooked to perfection. The family's cafe in front offers equally delicious baked goods and coffees. Carisma is a must-try for those seeking more than just the usual tacos and burritos. Highly recommended!",
    "Hidden gem serving delicious Senegalese and West African cuisine, including a tasty Thiboudienne without tomato sauce and a flavorful Jollof Rice. Cozy atmosphere with a few hightop tables or takeout option available. Friendly service.",
    "Tried the falafel wrap again today after a previous average experience. Disappointingly, very little flavor except for excessive saltiness. The falafels and pita were lacking in taste, and even the tzatziki sauce couldn't salvage it. The sauce resembled a tasteless glue rather than the flavorful one expected. The only redeeming aspect was the fresh diced cucumber and tomato, but sadly overshadowed by the unsatisfying white sauce that shouldn't be called tzatziki :(",
    "This place strikes the perfect balance between upscale and casual. Whether you're dressed to the nines with your Gucci bag or rocking your comfy yoga pants, you can enjoy a selection of decadent cocktails.",
    "Our group of 6 decided to try something different and gave this place a shot. Very happy with our decision. The special was a massive amount of food for two people and it was a great sampling of all their options. The chicken, steak, and rice/beans were amazing. The egg was easy enough to push away and the yuca wasn't bad. The plantains were delicious. Didn't try the salad, but overall, a must-visit if you're up for trying something new.",
    "The lunch today was absolutely amazing. The pulled pork and smokehouse bowl were accompanied by incredibly delicious sides of sweet potato casserole and red beans and rice. The red beans and rice had a nice kick to it, while the sweet potato casserole was absolutely yummy. The meat was perfectly smoky, juicy, and there was plenty of it. This place is definitely a must-visit.",
    "Incredible results! My neglected car underwent the executive detailing and now it looks brand new.",
    "We visited from Colorado to potentially buy a second home and had a great experience. Jen at the front desk was incredibly kind and helpful, speaking highly of the club and its amenities. We also met Joe, the general manager, who was terrific. Though smaller than other lifetimes, the club offers top-notch service. The bathrooms are fantastic and fully stocked with toiletries, and the location next to the mall is excellent. Highly recommend.",
    "Tried the pulled pork, green beans, Mac n cheese, and cornbread. Mediocre barbecue with a dry pork but decent smoky flavor. The sweet/syrupy original bbq sauce was okay. Might return, but would prefer a better option closer to home.",
    "We made the mistake of visiting on a Lenten Friday and experienced a long wait. The blackened alligator was greasy, but the raw oysters were fresh. The lack of communication about the oysters being only raw was disappointing. The entrees took a while to arrive, and the roast beef was salty while the tuna and shrimp kabob was bland. The seafood boil seemed like a better option. Overall, the place is okay considering the price.",
    "I only gave this place one star for their horrible customer service. They advertised a 50% off discount for students, but when I arrived with my ID, they told me it was only valid on certain days. Despite making an appointment and being assured of the discount, they refused to honor it. The owner, John Jay, also refused to rectify the situation and treated me patronizingly. I left upset and wasted 45 minutes of my time. If you value good customer service, I suggest skipping this place for your next haircut.",
    "This Chinese restaurant is the go-to spot for amazing food and a perfect choice for sharing a variety of mouthwatering spicy dishes with a big group. Consistently delivering top-notch quality, I have never encountered a disappointing dish here. It's a guaranteed crowd-pleaser that lives up to its well-deserved reputation.",
    "The Bricks of Ybor in Tampa is a must-visit restaurant with phenomenal meat sandwiches. The pulled pork on Hawaiian sweet bread is one of the best meals I've had. The owner, Brian, made us feel welcome and comped us a drink. The diverse crowd speaks to the menu and pleasant environment. Despite the crowds, the service remained excellent. I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back on my next visit to Tampa.",
    "Highly recommended! The crepes and pancakes were amazing, and even the grits stood out. Well worth the wait!",
    "My sister-in-law and I visited this restaurant on 8/28/15 and it was a disappointing experience. Despite requesting multiple times, the hostess spoke too quietly for us to hear over the background music. We were seated in a booth with a never-ending Larry King vitamin commercial on the TV, which was not enjoyable. Our waitress introduced herself and a trainee, but they were absent for the rest of the meal and we were unsure who was responsible for our table. The food took a long time to arrive, considering the restaurant was not busy. The blue cheese burger had an overwhelming amount of blue cheese and could have been better with less. The fries and onion sticks were tasty though. No one came to check if we were satisfied or needed anything and it took two requests and waiting time to get a carry-out box. Additionally, another family had been waiting for their food since before we arrived, which was concerning. Overall, I do not plan on returning to this restaurant in the future.",
    "The food at this place was decently good, but way too expensive. The guacamole and Mojito were the highlights, while the peach pork medallions lacked flavor. The corn cakes with Barbacoa were pretty good though. The atmosphere was inviting and had a hip feel. However, the parking situation was annoying with limited spaces and no valet service. Ended up parking three blocks away and sweating in the summer heat to get to the entrance.",
    "Overall, my experience at Rusty Pelican was good. However, the initial interaction with the hostess was disappointing. We had called ahead, made a reservation, and requested a window seat overlooking the water. The hostess initially tried to seat us away from the window and seemed annoyed when we asked about it. She eventually accommodated our request, but it left a sour taste. Thankfully, Liz, our server, provided excellent service, and the drinks, food, and wait staff were all top-notch. However, the hostess's behavior was a letdown.",
    "The wine at this winery is average, but the location on the pier is fantastic. The staff is friendly and accommodating. However, the wine club is expensive and offers limited benefits. Visit for the beautiful setting and tasting, but skip the wine club.",
    "I had a negative experience with a cheap haircut in NY, resulting in a disastrous outcome. However, for my job interviews, I decided to try Domenick's and was pleasantly surprised. Robert did a fantastic job and the whole experience was worth $35. It was a bit expensive for me, but considering the final result, I felt human again. I'm not sure what the usual price range is in Philly, though. Overall, I would rate it a 4.",
    "I am extremely disappointed with the service received at Monro Muffler. They underfilled our engine with oil, causing damage, and their insurance company was unhelpful. The service associate, Joe, was rude and unprofessional, leaving my wife in tears. We were loyal customers, but this experience has lost them a lifelong customer. I will not be returning and will look elsewhere for future car services and purchases.",
    "Beautiful Clean Shop: The shop is clean and well-maintained, creating a pleasant atmosphere. The display of homemade breakfast tarts and chicken pot pies is impressive. The sweets are not only visually appealing but delicious as well. While some items may be slightly pricey considering their small sizes, the quality justifies the cost. It is a great place for locals and worth a visit, even for those coming from the center city. The counter staff is friendly and engaging. I will definitely return and highly recommend it.",
    "Overall, the pancakes at this place were decent but a bit dry. It's recommended to arrive before 8:30am to avoid a long wait. My friends tried different flavors and they were all okay. Personally, I don't understand the hype around this place. If the line is short, it's an alright option for a regular breakfast. However, if the line is long, I highly suggest going to Fido down the street for amazing coffee and breakfast food.",
    "The service advisors at this Honda dealer are extremely poor, especially since the departure of Kelly and her team. However, the convenience of getting an oil change before reaching another Honda dealer is a potential advantage.",
    "This hidden gem serves the best soon-dubu in the city! The cozy atmosphere and warm, welcoming feel make it feel like you're dining in a Korean home. The soft tofu stew is incredibly flavorful and can be customized to your liking, with options for beef, seafood, mushroom, or just plain. The extra hot with hot temperature is a must-try for spice lovers. The dol-sot rice adds a delightful crispy touch. Even if you're not a tofu fan, they offer delicious Korean BBQ meats and other soup/stew options. I can't help but salivate just thinking about it! Absolutely love this place!",
    "This motel offers great value for the price. It is clean, comfortable, and well-managed. The breakfast buffet is average, but reasonable considering the rate. However, the pool is a disappointment as it is too small for laps. On a positive note, the lobby area is spacious and comfortable. If you are seeking a moderately priced, clean, and comfortable place to sleep, this motel will meet your needs effectively.",
    "I expressed frustration regarding the lack of contact information for the owner and the state of cleanliness and maintenance of the columbarium. Despite my request for improvements, the person I dealt with did not acknowledge the need for action or display any empathy.",
    "This deli offers fast, delicious, and attentive service. The vegetarian breakfast sandwiches are a must-try, especially the veggie sausage with havarti on an everything bagel. The menu has options for everyone, including chicken cheesesteak hoagie and chicken salad on a croissant. The food tastes fresh and is priced reasonably. The staff is helpful and accommodating. Moreover, the deli has a great snack selection, including amazing chocolate bars, a variety of chips, and addictive hi-chew candies in every flavor. Highly recommend!",
    "Delicious brunch with amazing options like the 3 meat hash, turkey sandwich, and bagel/salmon. Friendly and accommodating staff. Prices were a bit high but definitely worth it. Will return when in the area.",
    "Located at the far end of Terminal E at Tampa International, this hidden gem is one of the airport's new restaurants with a local vibe. Despite limited seating, it's a great place to catch a game on their TVs away from the TSA area. The food is reasonably priced, with appetizers ranging from $5 to $10 and most sandwiches priced at $12. Although I didn't try the food, it looked amazing. Drinks are tasty and reasonably priced, like the 22oz Jai Alai for $8.50. You can't take alcoholic beverages into the terminal, but the staff is attentive and friendly. This will be my go-to spot when waiting for a Delta flight.",
    "The depot burger and shishito peppers are incredibly delicious. The food, atmosphere, and drinks are all perfect.",
    "The store's quality and selection have significantly declined in recent years. The produce is not fresh and overpriced, while organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. Additionally, the store's organization and customer service have worsened, with aisles roped off and difficulty reaching the register. I faced frustration from staff while trying to purchase soup. Overall, a disappointing experience and I will be switching to Wegmans for my shopping needs.",
    "This hidden gem in a strip mall exceeded all expectations. The modern and romantic atmosphere sets the perfect stage for an amazing dining experience. The food, particularly the Fois gras, was exceptional. The prix fixe menu with three courses allowed me to fully indulge in the delicious offerings. While the short ribs were great, I'm excited to try something new on my next visit. The desserts, especially the caramel tart, were simply heavenly. I can't wait to return to this incredible restaurant!",
    "I had a terrible group dining experience at this restaurant. Despite having a reservation, the service was extremely slow and inattentive. It took forever for them to bring our wine and even longer for our food. They forgot about the birthday celebration and only brought out a couple of cookies with a candle. The food was mediocre, with only a few dishes standing out. The atmosphere was nice, but the overall service was horrendous. This restaurant doesn't live up to the hype it receives.",
    "This place offers delicious food at an affordable price. The steak was tender and the shrimp were perfectly cooked. I would definitely return in the future.",
    "We chose Tako based on positive Yelp reviews but were disappointed with the lack of service and slow delivery of appetizers. The edamame was overcooked and the spring roll seemed frozen and unappetizing. However, the sushi itself was good, although not outstanding. Considering the slow service and underwhelming appetizers, I would not order them again if I were to return.",
    "The catfish, chicken, gumbo, and mac & cheese at this recommended local place are simply irresistible. The lunch buffet offered piping hot and fresh dishes. Definitely worth trying!",
    "See's Candies is a California-based bakery that has a temporary store in Tampa, Florida, at the International Plaza Mall. They offer soft and tasty chocolates, and you can try samples before buying. Their assortment of chocolates, including flavors like nut, mint, toffee, milk, white, and dark chocolate, are all delicious. They also offer the option of mail ordering through their website. It's a guilty pleasure that's worth a visit if you're in the area.",
    "R2L offers a classy and incredible dining experience on the 37th floor of Two Liberty Place. Despite not having a window-facing table, we still enjoyed stunning views of the sunset and city skyline. The menu for Center City Restaurant Week provided multiple choices for each course. I loved the crispy peas/ham/garlic risotto balls as an appetizer and the Butcher's Filet as the main course, although it was quite heavy. The milk chocolate + hazelnut pudding was a dazzling and delicious dessert. The waiter's attentiveness and the overall ambiance added to the wonderful experience.",
    "Becca is an exceptional bartender, with an impressive happy hour featuring land shark beer. Although the food menu is limited, the bar service is exceptional. We sincerely hope to see their business flourish and attract more local patrons.",
    "First visit to this location was a disappointment. Didn't receive change or receipt, despite asking for it. No spoon for chili and old cheese on burger indicated lack of attention to detail. Burger tasted alright, but overall experience made me reluctant to return.",
    "This family restaurant offers great prices for their family style menu. The pot roast we ordered was just as tasty as dining in, even as takeout. The packaging was done well, keeping our food warm throughout the 30-minute car ride. The portion size was sufficient for a family of four. Lastly, the green beans were amazing! Overall, while it may not have any unique elements, I highly recommend this good and affordable family restaurant.",
    "Ordered a Caramel Frappe at the drive-thru, regretted it. Waited 30 minutes with just 2 cars ahead.",
    "This place is amazing! The pizza cookies are a must-try and came hot, soft, and crazy delicious. We tried the Peanut butter and Oreo flavors, both were perfection. Being open until 3am is a brilliant move. The only downside is the prices, but when craving a fresh baked cookie pizza late at night, it's totally worth it.",
    "The best restaurant in Philadelphia with excellent food, attentive service, and a delightful dessert. The tahini and bread are addictive, the organic beef shishkabob is superb, and the purslane salad is dream-worthy. The chicken dish with black eyed peas, green peas, and fantastic rice is beyond words. The pistachio creme brulee is pure heaven. Despite the time constraints, the service was impeccable. This is a must-visit restaurant in Philly. Kudos to the chef!",
    "The service was disappointing - frozen pizza and skunked beer. Need I say more?",
    "Avoid this place at all costs! Our entire family fell ill after eating here and the frozen yogurt, while visually appealing, was incredibly disappointing in terms of taste. Absolutely not worth a second visit or recommending to anyone.",
    "This place is a hidden gem for authentic, delicious Indian street food. I've tried a variety of dishes here and each one, from bhel puri to pav bhaji, vada pav to deconstructed samosa, aloo tikki to dabeli, and even kulfi, was incredibly well-prepared. Wish I had discovered it earlier.",
    "The Saint: A memorable experience, but not for the faint of heart. Unwanted advances, drunk patrons, and questionable atmosphere. The outdoor seating is a saving grace.",
    "The food is amazing and fresh, especially the Wonton Soup that my kids love. They clearly put time and effort into cooking it.",
    "The food was excellent, but the hospitality was very disappointing. Despite the restaurant still being open for another 45 minutes, they refused to let us dine in and only offered takeout. This was especially frustrating as we had pregnant women and a child with us, and explained that we had a long drive ahead. We had to go back home and make everyone eat there. I'm extremely disappointed with their treatment of customers and will not be returning. It's hard to forgive them for denying dining to pregnant women.",
    "This place exceeded our expectations! The steak is unmatched by any other steak house I've visited. The staff, including the hostess Mallory, our waiter Max, and the busboy, work together flawlessly, ensuring a seamless dining experience. We were thoroughly impressed and will definitely return. Love this place!",
    "I highly recommend this service! Dr. Dinh was kind and attentive, addressing all my concerns during the exam. The wide selection of frames was a plus, and the receptionist was extremely helpful and patient. Overall, a great experience and I will definitely return for my yearly exam.",
    "Terrible pizza, slow and rude delivery, incorrect change with only coins. Avoid this place at all costs!",
    "I tried the Sonoran hot dog at this highly recommended place during my visit. While it wasn't my personal preference due to its complexity, I have to admit it was good. However, the standout for me was the fantastic guacamole. The taco combo with chicken and carne asada was delicious, but the cabeza option was disappointing. I loved the convenience of BK's salsa bar and the efficient service with quick food delivery. Do note that it gets crowded during lunchtime on weekdays.",
    "The restaurant had open tables, despite us being told window tables were all reserved. Food was good, with filet and salmon options. However, we were not informed about the $75 recommended wine, only that it was the last bottle available.",
    "This Indian restaurant is the best I've ever been to! The food is incredibly fresh and delicious, particularly the palak paneer and biryani. The staff is friendly and attentive, and the overall ambiance is clean and welcoming.",
    "The smoothies here are the best in the world, and their fresh bread is amazing. The staff is extremely knowledgeable.",
    "My recent visit to Bell Meade in Nashville left me thoroughly impressed. Even though I couldn't find the specific bourbon I was looking for, the experience was fantastic. The tasting bar was delightful, and Max's conversation made my visit even more enjoyable. I managed to grab a bottle of Tennessee whiskey cream that I can't find anywhere else. With a five-star rating, I'll definitely be returning to Bell Meade on my next trip to Nashville.",
    "This place is a gem for fresh seafood lovers. The food is delicious, especially the local crab special. The fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari, and scallops is also worth trying. The view is stunning, but be prepared to wait for a table. The waitress was helpful and friendly. Parking may be a bit challenging, but overall, it's a great spot for a seafood feast.",
    "I strongly advise against choosing this option. The manager and wait staff displayed incredibly rude and unprofessional behavior. The food was mediocre at best, and the prices for drinks were exorbitant. Save yourself the disappointment and go elsewhere.",
    "Despite it being my first experience with Nola food, I'm afraid my visit to this restaurant had a rough start. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed and made mistakes with our orders, including forgetting my drink and mixing up my friend's plate. The shrimp po'boy that I ordered was disappointing, with minimal lettuce and sauce accompanied by weak and soggy fries. Although other reviews indicate that this might have been an off-day for them, I sadly will not be returning and have to give a lackluster review.",
    "This place is in desperate need of an update. It feels unsafe and definitely not suitable for kids. The service is average and everything looks worn out. The comedy club lacks any cheer or excitement, resembling a dingy banquet room. On the upside, the parking is convenient and the location is good. The owners should seriously consider investing in a renovation.",
    "I had a great stay at the Orange St location. The apartment was spacious and had everything I needed. The only downside was that I couldn't open the windows for fresh air. The place was quiet and perfect for studying. I would definitely stay here again.",
    "I have been a loyal customer at this restaurant for 15 years due to its amazing location and great service. However, I am disappointed with the inconsistent quality of the steak and feel it's unfair to blame the server. Despite this, I am still willing to pay a higher price for a good quality steak.",
    "I had a terrible experience with this dealership. I made a mistake by purchasing a vehicle out of my budget, and when I tried to contact the salesman to explain, he ignored me. Finally, when I went in person, they informed me that my loan had been funded and the title had been changed, meaning I would have to sell the car back as used. I would lose a significant amount of money. Later, the bank called to say the loan had not been funded and would not approve it. The dealership has been unresponsive to my numerous messages, even after contacting an attorney. Avoid this dealership at all costs, they will lie to your face.",
    "Desi Village in KOP may lack ambiance, but the delicious food makes up for it. Despite the tired decor and the unattractive strip mall location, the dishes such as Keema Naan, Samosas, Saag Paneer, and Lamb Biryani are perfectly seasoned, not greasy, and just the right level of spicy. Their attentiveness to special dietary requests, such as allergies, is commendable. Although it would be nice if they upgraded their surroundings, the food remains the highlight, making a return visit a must.",
    "LA Smokehouse is absolutely amazing! After being let down by another barbecue place, we stumbled upon this gem in Mid City. The friendly staff explained everything and the food blew us away. The pulled pork was perfection, not overly sauced. The mac and cheese were incredible, and the grits had a unique smoky flavor. The owner made sure we were happy and the atmosphere was casual and comfortable. We'll definitely be coming back for more of this delicious food. LA Smokehouse is now on our BBQ favorites list!",
    "Iris has earned its spot at the top of my favorites list in New Orleans. From the excellent food and drinks, to the impeccable service and inviting atmosphere, every aspect of this restaurant surpassed my expectations. Despite not knowing the exact number of guests, Iris went above and beyond to ensure our comfort. The layout allowed for easy movement, and the music selection was enjoyable without disrupting conversation. Our waiter was attentive and anticipated our needs perfectly. The limited lunch drink menu did not disappoint, and the food was creatively arranged and delicious. I appreciated the European-sized portions and the use of locally sourced ingredients. Opting for the prix fixe menu offered great value, and I will definitely be returning regardless of the group size.",
    "Great atmosphere and decor with super friendly staff. Lunch special of Pad Thai with chicken was flavorful and portion size was good. Chicken satay for dinner was a bit disappointing with only two small skewers, but flavor and peanut dipping sauce were excellent. Panang Curry had a good portion size and came with a side of rice. Disappointed that they don't have Pad See Ew, but still willing to try other menu options. Overall, great customer service and I look forward to returning soon!",
    "Petra Restaurant near our home offers delicious Middle Eastern cuisine. We randomly decided to try it with my family and were pleasantly surprised. The Friday and Saturday special rice with lamb is especially delicious, reminiscent of Indian fried rice. The other menu items are also very good. Despite the location, the inside of the restaurant is nice and the service is good too.",
    "I had an amazing birthday experience at The Pearl! Impeccable food, wine, and service, and the staff were so accommodating even after closing time.",
    "I stopped by Albertsons because I wanted some snacks. The store was clean, well-stocked with wide aisles and a good selection of bakery items, flowers, and regular groceries. What impressed me was that they had some locally made snacks like California Kettle Corn and Taco Works. I found the chips I wanted that other stores don't always carry and grabbed a Diet Coke at the checkout. The parking lot was convenient and the staff was friendly and helpful. Thank you, Albertsons!",
    "The recent change in ownership resulted in a disappointing experience with both the food and service. It's a shame as I used to love this place.",
    "Dr. Gloudemans is a fantastic doctor who is knowledgeable, friendly, and up-to-date with the latest research. She strongly supports vaccinations, which is a major plus. She takes a proactive approach to health concerns, suggesting follow-ups if necessary. However, there have been some billing issues that caused frustration, but they were resolved after a phone call.",
    "I attended a meeting at the Homebuilders Association of New Orleans and had a great experience. The food was delicious, particularly the corn and crab soup and the grits and grillades. The portions were a bit small, but the taste made up for it. The mimosa was also good. The price was around $10, which is reasonable. I didn't get to test the Wi-Fi, but based on the ambiance and quality of food, I would definitely go back.",
    "The Frist's cafe is not my regular choice for lunch, but on occasional dreary days, I indulge in their Cobb Salad. Perfect for gluten-free diners, I recommend adding an extra egg for a protein boost. With affordable prices and quick service, it attracts museum visitors and local employees. However, be wary of Senior Mondays and weekend lunchtimes, as it tends to get busy around 11:30-noon.",
    "Ghini's serves incredibly delicious food, especially for French breakfast lovers. The eggs provencale, with basted eggs, hot house tomato, and fragrant herbs, are a unique and tasty choice. Don't forget to try the baguette toast and add the affordable hashbrowns. The crepes, both sweet and savory, are also delightful, with the spinach and Swiss being a personal favorite. Highly recommended.",
    "I highly recommend this unique spot! The graffiti-style art on the walls, delicious food options, and special hummus flavors make it stand out. The prices are good, and the portion size is great. I thoroughly enjoyed the Greek steak pita with guac hummus. I will definitely be returning!",
    "Prep & Pastry is a must-visit brunch spot in town. The trick of adding your name to the waitlist before arriving is a game-changer. The food, especially the breakfast sandwich, is consistently excellent, including their sweets. Their iced tea is top-notch. The staff is incredibly friendly. Highly recommended.",
    "The Fringe festival in Edmonton offers a fantastic variety of performances, street performers, and musicians. The venue and play options are diverse, and there is a convenient online schedule for show times and ticket purchasing. The addition of food and artisan vendors adds to the overall experience. Don't miss the delicious gourmet mini donut truck hidden behind the farmers market. Even without watching a play, it's enjoyable to explore the street performances and shop at the vendors. The location is excellent.",
    "I used to love this place, but it has really gone downhill. The customer service was disappointing, with an unhelpful server who didn't even offer a tea to go. The food was okay, but not enough to make up for the poor treatment. The deteriorating benches with tape on them also looked tacky. Sadly, this is no longer my favorite lunch spot and I won't be returning.",
    "Prompt communication is definitely a plus. However, we decided to go with a different plumber for the current job due to their higher quote compared to others we interviewed. Despite this, we may reconsider them for future projects as they appear to be reliable, and quality often comes with a higher price.",
    "Absolutely delicious Mexican food in Florida! I fell in love with it from my first bite and have been returning ever since!",
    "Real Thai food with the option to make it spicy. Soups are a standout, while curries have great flavor but can be runny. Veggie eggrolls are okay, might be better with meat filling.",
    "Jump on the School Bus was the perfect choice for our winery and brewery tour and wedding transportation. Darin and Sierra were flexible and accommodating, making last minute adjustments as needed. Their attention to detail and quality, including a visit to one of the wineries, exceeded our expectations. Our driver was knowledgeable and provided great suggestions. Highly recommended for any wine and beer tour or wedding transportation needs!",
    "Bailey's Range is a must-visit spot for out-of-town guests. The burgers are incredible and the boozy shakes are unmatched. The horchata shake is a dream! The location is perfect, close to downtown attractions. The burger selection is extensive, offering unique combinations like mac n cheese patties. The honest waitstaff is a refreshing touch. The burger showdown is a fun event. The only drawback is occasional overcooking of requested burger temperatures. Overall, highly recommended with a 4/5 rating.",
    "This breakfast sandwich on a biscuit is absolutely amazing\u2014possibly the best ever! So delicious!",
    "I had a terrible experience at the university location of Silver Mine. The staff made mistakes with my order, the food was cold, and the employee was rude. I will never be returning to this place again. Goodbye Silver Mine!",
    "I had a fabulous experience at this salon! Grace did an amazing job on my difficult hair, which is super long and thick. The atmosphere was great - modern, clean, and no snobbiness. Pricing was totally reasonable. Highly recommend!",
    "The food at this cozy Sunday Buffet was delicious - from the fried chicken to the greens, smothered steak, corn, and cabbage. It felt like eating at your grandmother's house. Despite not being a fancy restaurant, the fair price and local recommendations made it worth any wait. This place truly exceeded my expectations.",
    "I recently ordered a Passion Passport and absolutely loved it! The combination of passion fruit juice blend, bananas, pineapple mango juice blend, papaya juice blend, and raw cane sugar was simply delicious and refreshingly satisfying. The name itself truly captures its delectable essence.",
    "We had a fantastic private tour with Carrie today. Despite the rain and less crowded park, her enthusiasm and extensive knowledge about the Civil War were truly captivating. The Battle of Franklin is undoubtedly deserving of its own remarkable memorial.",
    "I highly recommend this automotive service. They offer the best prices in town and the level of customer service is outstanding. From the first phone call, I was treated wonderfully and they addressed all my concerns. They managed to fit me in that same day when I had a cracked windshield, and not only did they fix it efficiently, but also vacuumed, wiped down the inside of my car, and washed the windows. The waiting area is cozy and they even offer complimentary tea, water, and candies. Unlike my previous experience with fast glass, they treated me with respect and made me feel valued. I will definitely be returning to this place for any future automotive needs.",
    "Reviewer is extremely upset about discovering an unexpected $220 overdraft fee and being put on hold for 45 minutes when calling TD Bank for assistance. The representative was helpful but failed to mention the long wait. Learned that TD Bank's new policy charges overdraft fees instead of declining transactions with insufficient funds. The reviewer expresses frustration and plans to switch banks. Also mentions rebellious behavior toward the bank's cameras while making a deposit.",
    "Great 3-night stay at Four Points in November. Smooth check-in, competitive room rate with free breakfast included. Convenient location close to the airport with other hotels nearby. Friendly and helpful staff, comfortable room, and hassle-free parking. Peaceful nights.",
    "Located conveniently near Union Station Metro, this hotel is a great value on weekends. Prices skyrocket during the week due to business travelers. The room was clean, the bed was luxuriously comfortable with plenty of pillows. The spacious bathroom had a bathtub and an abundant supply of white towels. Deducted one star due to the poor coffee machine in the room and the thin door that allowed noise from the hallway. However, the main lobby is impressive and definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",
    "The Mexican food here is exceptional. The fried fish taco is amazing, and everything else is just as good. My only regret is not getting their red sauce and birria to-go. Note that there is no air conditioning, but the food makes up for it.",
    "Endurance House is a game-changer for runners. Their vast shoe selection, friendly staff, and personalized assistance in finding the perfect pair to enhance your stride and prevent injuries sets them apart. I'll definitely be a returning customer, knowing I'll get a great price and top-notch shoes every time.",
    "HipCity offers a super lunch option for both meat-eaters and vegetarians. Their buffalo bella and crispy hipcity ranch sandwiches are amazing alternatives, and the green lemonade is a great pairing. The staff is friendly and efficient, but the small space can get congested and confusing during peak times. Overall, the food is great.",
    "This place falsely advertised a 10PM closing time but denied service at 8:30PM. Unlocked doors and covered kitchen equipment were perplexing. Ridiculously early closure.",
    "No contest, this place has the best Chinese food in town. Owners are incredibly pleasant, and their complimentary wontons make waiting for takeout so enjoyable.",
    "Rosemary's Grill is my favorite restaurant. The menu offers a wide variety of delicious Classic American and Turkish cuisine. The kebabs are particularly amazing, especially the Adana kebab. The portion sizes are generous and the staff treats you like part of their family. The quality of the food and service is exceptional. This place is truly our favorite spot and we highly recommend it.",
    "The staff is extremely friendly and the environment is pleasant. Surprisingly, there were not many people both times I visited. However, the $3.50 margaritas after 4 on Tuesdays are delicious.",
    "I would not recommend this place, even if it's the only option at 2am. The basic general tso's did not meet my expectations. I suggest trying East Cuisine instead.",
    "The food at this place is good, with the blueberry lasagna and chocolate confection being superb. However, the waiter had a pretentious and haughty attitude, which almost made me give this place a higher rating.",
    "The flavors at this ice cream shop are a pleasant surprise. I tried various flavors including Bananas Foster, Pear Champagne Sorbet, Blueberry Fig Sorbet, and Cassis sorbet. While all flavors were good, the Cassis started off subtly and grew in flavor with each bite. It's definitely worth returning with friends to enjoy this delightful frozen treat.",
    "Best pizza ever, hands down! The people running the place, especially the former hockey player and his adorable but tough wife, are hilarious. They make their own sausage and mozzarella, and their attention to detail is unmatched. Don't even think about mispronouncing Ricotta! Every pizza on the menu is fabulous, and even the crusts are worth savoring. Try dipping them in olive oil or their delicious vinaigrette for an extra treat.",
    "The sales staff was friendly and Mike was extremely helpful. He took us for a ride in one of the Razors, which was a great experience. It made us consider getting one ourselves.",
    "This place is a gem! Good food, great service, and their zucchini muffins are a must-try! I can't resist taking some home with me. Prices are affordable and the frozen yogurt bar with unlimited toppings is fantastic. Highly recommended for a delightful experience. Yum yum!",
    "The all-you-can-eat experience was disappointing due to long wait times and poor service. The rolls had undisclosed extras, including an unpleasant surprise of sweet mustard sauce. However, once the orders were placed, they were prepared relatively quickly.",
    "The restaurant had a beautiful ambiance and was spotless. Everyone in our group loved their meals. Although my dish arrived late, the fried green tomatoes were superb and the accompanying sauce was delicious. The chicken salad, fried bologna sandwich, and cheeseburger were also top-notch. Don't miss out on the peach cobbler dessert, especially with a side of ice cream - it won't disappoint!",
    "The food is enjoyable; however, the cafe's uncleanliness is a major downfall. Unlikely to revisit until cleanliness is improved.",
    "We loved this place! Delicious food, generous portions, and the chicken parm was absolutely scrumptious. Can't wait to return and explore more of their menu!",
    "Overall, this burger joint is decent. The bacon cheeseburger was impressive, with perfectly cooked bacon and a nicely toasted bun. The fries and chocolate shake were also enjoyable. However, I found the burger lacking juiciness and the portion size for the price was disappointing. Additionally, leaving the place smelling like burger grease was not ideal.",
    "After reading good Yelp reviews, I tried this place out. It was empty and the food was average. Disappointed, I ended up going to Charlie's across the street. The bustling atmosphere and amazing redtop pizza made me regret not going there first. This place is decent for a sit-down meal but for great pizza, go to Charlie's.",
    "This Whole Foods location is a gem. The variety of natural cosmetics and handmade soaps in the personal care section is unmatched. The produce, seafood, and cheese are also top-notch. The deli offers a delightful selection of soup, salad, and sushi to-go boxes. And don't forget to try the lavender soda for a truly calming experience.",
    "The Mediterranean chicken quesadillas are absolutely amazing with an awesome sauce! Highly recommend to Greek food lovers.",
    "Incredible place! Spacious, modern, and impeccably clean. Will, Amanda, and Sal are amazing. Always there to help, especially for a newbie like me. Wide variety of juices, mods, and atty's to try. Totally in love with this spot!",
    "Great tasting breakfast options, tried nearly everything and this place is definitely the spot for breakfast. Only gripe is that the monte cisto is overpriced for what it is, not worth it unless they lower the price by $5. Everything else tastes great, especially the Jebbs open face and huevos rancheros. Coffee is addictive. No reservations, arrive early or 30 minutes before you're hungry. Enjoy.",
    "Had a terrible experience at this place. Called ahead to request a deboned duck, but the girl answering the phone had trouble understanding my order. Ended up receiving a whole duck with stuffing I did not ask for. When I called to complain, they offered no compensation, only a trade-in option. Disappointed with the terrible customer service overshadowing the food.",
    "I highly recommend visiting the preserve! The hikes are enjoyable with abundant wildlife, and the paths are well-marked. The birds of prey aviary is impressive and the learning center is both educational and comfortable. The staff and volunteers are friendly and helpful. Don't miss the chance to see the birds up close with the handlers in the mid afternoon.",
    "This diner in North Wilmington is average at best. The food is ordinary and there is nothing remarkable about the place. It served as a decent choice after swim meets, but there are no standout qualities to mention.",
    "We thoroughly enjoyed the food, service, and decor at this restaurant! Upon our arrival, the manager greeted us warmly with a huge smile. Our server, Christina, was delightful. The beer selection was impressive, and we particularly loved the chicken rabe sandwich on tasty focaccia bread. The pepperoni pizza was superb, perfectly cooked to our \"well done\" preference. We plan on returning, although our only concern is the absence of a children's menu for our picky 7-year-old.",
    "I regularly visit student salons for haircuts and styling, including the Aveda Institute. The results can vary due to different stylists, but overall, the experience has been positive. Keep in mind that the cuts can take longer compared to professionals, usually around 2 hours. The basic cut includes a wash, cut, and blowdry style, with the stylists checking in with their teachers for guidance. The stylists at Aveda have been professional and dedicated, and the prices are affordable.",
    "Great food, friendly staff. Fast service and generous portions. Highly recommend sitting outside for a good dining experience.",
    "The food and service were excellent. The menu offers a great variety of options. I highly recommend trying the Monte Cristo crepes, they were absolutely amazing. I'll definitely be returning.",
    "This hidden gem on Bourbon St. is a great alternative to Cafe du Monde. The beignets were delicious, if not better, and the best part was no line! It's a calm oasis in the morning, although the lack of live music was a downside. The full breakfast options like the crawfish omelet and Cajun hashbrowns were decent but, let's be honest, the beignets steal the show.",
    "Mixx offers a vast menu and affordable prices, making it a perfect option for those seeking fast and budget-friendly sushi. The quality may not be the city's finest, but if you're in a hurry, it's a great choice.",
    "Extremely unprofessional and disrespectful. Initially received reasonable quotes from a friendly staff member for a battery and brakes. However, when I called to schedule an appointment, a rude individual named Mike or Nick denied the previously offered price, blaming me instead. Upon requesting to speak to someone else, he abruptly ended the call. I strongly advise against contacting this establishment. Will opt for Walmart instead.",
    "I would strongly advise against choosing this place for any type of service or purchase. The lack of a dedicated customer service department is a major flaw. They rely on their sales team to handle customer inquiries, resulting in frustrating experiences where calls go unanswered or are directed to voicemail. Even leaving a voicemail for the manager proved futile, as they did not bother to return the call. \n\nDuring the car purchase process, I encountered several issues. Promised adjustments, such as removing tint on the rear window, were not fulfilled. Furthermore, the sales manager initially miscalculated the price, but I had to insist on sticking to the agreed-upon amount. These troubles persisted when attempts were made to remove the tint, necessitating multiple visits and a significant amount of time. \n\nMoreover, the service department proved equally unhelpful. When I sought guidance regarding a warranty claim for a leaky trunk, the lack of knowledge and assistance from the staff was disheartening. Given the poor overall service experience, I cannot trust them to properly address my concerns. \n\nIn summary, having a dedicated customer service department is crucial for resolving complaints in a professional and timely manner. Relying solely on the sales team for customer service is not a viable approach. The salesperson tried their best, but the lack of support from management and other departments leaves a negative impression overall.",
    "I highly recommend this restaurant as the owners are incredibly kind and welcoming. The food is scrumptious, with the bacon pizza being my absolute favorite. It's wonderful that they have a play room for children, ensuring an enjoyable wait for our meal.",
    "This Asian restaurant is a must-visit! The fried rice is absolutely amazing and the prices are great. Highly recommended as one of the best in town.",
    "Harry's Blue Bell is a small, tucked away spot that seems to be popular among locals. The inside is nice but small, with limited tables. The service was average. The beer selection is great and the prices are reasonable. The food menu, however, is limited to basic bar food. The bbq pulled pork was good, but the sauce was too sweet. The chicken and honey mustard wrap was fresh but nothing special. The fries were hot and crispy, and the kale slaw was fantastic but in a small portion. Overall, it was a decent meal, but not worth going out of the way for. A solid 3 stars.",
    "Kajuns addressed the smoke issue with smoke eaters, making the air breathable for those sensitive to cigarette smoke. Headaches are no longer a problem, and it's hard to notice smoking while inside. Clothes may still smell like smoke after leaving, but overall, Kajuns staff is dedicated to improving customer experiences. Thank you, Kajuns!",
    "I was introduced to Brio's by my foodie friends at work, and I absolutely love it! From the complimentary bread and chips to the bruschetta, pasta, and salads, everything is delicious. The restaurant itself is beautiful, and the service is top-notch.",
    "Extremely disappointed with this Tucson establishment. Food was cold and service was shockingly rude. Although they seem to have a promising concept, their execution falls short.",
    "Gennaro's never disappoints. Thin crust, sweet tomato sauce, and fresh mozzarella make every bite delightful. The meatballs are also superb. Adorable vintage decor adds to the charm. Love it here!",
    "Stopped by on a Monday evening and found a lively atmosphere with friendly service. The bar had a good selection, though I can't speak for the drinks. However, the standout here is the food. The Pear Gorgonzola Melt was a plateful of deliciousness. Perfect spot for a tasty sandwich at a reasonable price (~$10) and watching sports.",
    "The restaurant had a pleasant atmosphere with friendly service and reasonable prices. However, the food was rather bland, not terrible but unremarkable. After a long drive, it satisfied our hunger, but our overall experience was middling and we probably won't return.",
    "Great spot for a drink with friendly staff. However, cleanliness concerns may deter me from dining there.",
    "This Greek-owned pancake house is a fantastic alternative to larger pancake chains. They offer delicious breakfast options like freedom toast and freedom fries. Every New Year's Day, we visit this place around 2 pm and they always accommodate our group of 12-15 people. The service is fast and friendly, and the owner ensures everything runs smoothly. In my opinion, the food is even better than the chains, and I think the secret ingredient is love.",
    "Unfortunately, my recent visit to Fresh was disappointing. The service and product quality were below their usual standard, and the prices were exorbitant. The staff didn't greet me upon entering, even though I understand that my group took up most of the space. Moreover, the Vienna Latte I ordered was not only one of the worst espresso drinks I've ever had, but it was also ridiculously expensive. This experience has definitely put me off from ordering anything from Fresh again, which is a shame because I've always praised their products in the past.",
    "Overall, the service for our large group was adequate but not exceptional. One member received their food late, and the closeout process could use improvement. Adding a tip for the large group made the bill easy. \nI ordered the lamb kebab plate with rice and babaghanoush. The rice was well-cooked and aromatic, while the babaghanoush was delicious with extra olive oil. The presentation of the dish was pleasant. Unfortunately, the meat was dry and lacked sufficient marinade. This area needs improvement.\nI've visited this restaurant before, and previous experiences were better, particularly during Ramadan when they offer an attractive and diverse buffet. The Ramadan buffet starts at 8:30, but it's best to arrive early due to high customer demand.",
    "I highly recommend this place for bird enthusiasts. Friendly staff and a great spot to visit on a Sunday morning.",
    "I had a pleasant dining experience at this old club turned restaurant. The food, particularly the sashimi plate and burger and fries, was delicious. However, the service was disappointing. I had to fetch my own plates, sauce bowls, and napkins, and they forgot to bring a glass for my son until I requested it. Despite this, the dinner was enjoyable, and I would consider returning if the service improved.",
    "Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken offers a flavorful and tender chicken that is marinated and seasoned to perfection. The smoky element from the charcoal oven adds a unique touch. The chicken is served with delicious dipping sauces, and the sides, such as cilantro rice and spicy pinto beans, complement the meal well. The maduros, or sweet plantains, are a must-try with their caramelized exterior and soft interior. Refreshing drinks like Inca cola and chicha limena complete the experience. This chicken is made with love and will redefine your perception of rotisserie chicken.",
    "I recently treated myself to a birthday meal at this place and it was amazing. The plain burger I ordered was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and despite feeling a little odd eating it with a knife and fork, it was worth it. The salad was decent with just the right amount of dressing. The bartender/waiter was attentive and made delicious sazeracs to complement my meal. I'll definitely be back to try their fancier burger options.",
    "I visited this place during lunchtime on a Monday and sat at the bar. The service was prompt and efficient. Opted for the carne asada taco lunch special and was pleasantly surprised by its above-average quality. Extremely satisfied with my experience here.",
    "I highly recommend these guys! Tony was incredibly helpful and fixed my flat tire for less than his initial estimate. Thank you!",
    "I had a fantastic experience with my hairdresser who was attentive to my preferences and made sure that I was satisfied throughout the entire haircut. Highly recommended!",
    "The sweet and sour chicken and chicken chow mein were both excellent, with particularly delicious chicken cuts in the chow mein. I've also tried the sushi a few times and thoroughly enjoyed it. While a bit pricey, the food is undeniably great.",
    "In summary, the reviewer had a negative experience with Comcast. Despite being a loyal customer for 14 years, their bill was consistently high and attempts to lower it were unsuccessful until they decided to cancel. The reviewer switched to Verizon and found better service and overall satisfaction. They express a strong dislike for Comcast and their perceived lack of concern for customer satisfaction.",
    "B's Diner is a hidden gem, filled with charming antiques and a friendly staff. The community support they provide makes them deserving of your patronage. If you're seeking an affordable and flavorful meal in a laid-back atmosphere, this is the place for you. While I haven't tried it yet, the Elk sausage and perogie poutine comes highly recommended. Enjoy the lively people-watching experience, from bar staff to hipsters and musicians.",
    "Food has drastically declined in quality at this restaurant over the past year. The buffet offerings are overwhelmingly salty, the pulled turkey is tough, and the fish tastes like meat tenderizer. Vegetables are overcooked and have a putty-like texture. The only somewhat enjoyable dishes were the corn pudding and mashed potatoes. Desserts are mediocre, resembling store-bought quality. On a positive note, the service was good, with prompt drink refills and plate removal.",
    "Horrible service, slow and unprofessional staff, disappointing food. Definitely avoid this place.",
    "Fellini's Cafe in Newtown Square is a romantic BYOB with big portions at decent prices. Although there were some hiccups in service and minor issues with the food, overall it was delicious and the manager's gesture of allowing an expired gift card was appreciated. I will continue visiting this restaurant as they do most things well and it's affordable.",
    "The Catbird Seat was underwhelming with a large, awkward entrance and strange seating arrangement. The drinks were average to bad, the crowd was stuffy, and the food was forgettable. The only highlight was the tenderloin, but overall, the experience was overpriced and disappointing.",
    "I visited Stitch-It in June 2013 and they did an excellent job on my dress. Despite the tight turnaround, they were able to accommodate me and the results far exceeded my expectations. I would definitely use them again.",
    "This place is absolutely amazing! The staff is incredible - from their exceptional work to their wonderful personalities. Jenne made me feel so comfortable during my first Brazilian and provided a fantastic blow-out. Plus, their sense of humor had me laughing throughout my visit. I'm eagerly looking forward to returning!",
    "If you're in New Jersey, particularly in Camden, Santana's is a must-visit for breakfast and pastries. Their coffee surpasses Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, and other well-known chains. The pastries are exceptional and rival those in Boricua, Puerto Rico. As a neighboring business in Pennsauken, we make it a daily stop.",
    "This place offers delicious food at a reasonable price. The escargot could have been more traditional, but still enjoyable. For an extra $50, you can dine with the ghost of the former owner who died on the second floor. The experience takes place at a solitary table in a cold, dungeon-like room.",
    "The best burger joint in Philly! Modest place with great food. Customizable menu, perfectly cooked burgers, and delicious hand-cut fries. Don't forget to download the SPOT app for rewards and free fries.",
    "I highly recommend these guys for getting replacement keys made for your car! My mechanic referred me to them and they definitely lived up to the recommendation. They took good care of me and were very thorough in their job. They made a test copy of my key before cutting on the blanks, which I really appreciated. They also checked that both keys worked in all doors and the trunk before giving them to me. Great attitude and attention to detail. Save yourself some money and go to these guys instead of the dealership!",
    "This salon is a stunning gem! Impeccably clean, organized, and with a delightful and knowledgeable staff. Owner Doug, a true standout with an impressive resume, offers regular training to keep his staff up-to-date. I trust this place implicitly with my hair. Highly recommended for both locals and visitors alike.",
    "Bab Cafe is a delightful addition to Reno's restaurant scene, offering a diverse menu and efficient service. The Dak-Galbi Bibim-bab, accompanied by fresh vegetables and delicious sauces, was incredibly satisfying. The potstickers were a definite highlight. The only downside is the challenging downtown parking situation.",
    "Mr. B's is a must-visit brunch spot in New Orleans. The Brandy Milk Punch is amazing and the shrimp and grits are to die for. Don't miss out on the fresh bread and butter too. Highly recommended!",
    "I highly recommend this salon based on their professional and clean environment. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about their services and prices. I had a great experience getting my armpits waxed, with Despina being a skilled specialist who made the process relatively painless. The hard wax used was effective on my stubborn, thick hair. The price was also reasonable at $16. I have already scheduled my next appointment and may come in sooner for a bikini wax. Overall, the service was excellent with a great atmosphere. Trustworthy salon!",
    "Gus, the falafel nazi, lives up to his reputation and more. Delicious chicken cooked over coal, perfectly cooked falafel, and fresh ingredients. Generous portions and worth the wait!",
    "SRS is an exceptional management company. Highly accommodating and responsive to specific requests. Highly recommended.",
    "Fresco serves wonderful fresh and tasty pizza at reasonable prices. The restaurant was clean and inviting, and the young owner's passion for quality food is evident. The meat-special pizza was crispy, tender, and loaded with toppings. Highly recommend!",
    "Overall, our experience at this restaurant was positive. The place was clean and nicely decorated, and the service was excellent and friendly. The food was good, especially for the parents, but it was too spicy for the kids and grandparents. The dim lighting made it difficult for the grandparents to read the menu. However, the veggie wings, cactus, and sweet potato burritos were delicious. The guacamole was also tasty, although the spicy chips were a bit overwhelming. One great thing about the restaurant was that they offered pitchers of margaritas, which was perfect for our large group.",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by Zaxby's as a self-proclaimed fast-food skeptic. The service was exceptional and the staff's enthusiasm was refreshing. The chicken finger sandwiches were juicy, although the greasy Texas toast was a minor setback. The sauce variety was good, but lacked some traditional Buffalo flavors. Despite these small flaws, the meal was enjoyable, and the affordable prices were a bonus. Zaxby's puts a unique southern spin on chicken fingers and I'm a fan.",
    "The baked goodies from this kitchen are simply outstanding. Each treat is filled with immense flavor and has the perfect texture. The delicate and decorative detailing is absolutely phenomenal, reflecting the time and love put into each piece. The signature flavors are all fantastic, and I particularly adore the classic cream cheese frosting. If you're seeking cakes, cupcakes, pies, cookies, or anything sweet, do yourself a favor and indulge in Sugar Coated. Treat yourself and your loved ones to this incredible experience!",
    "Despite the unique location and appealing brand and products, the service at this specific store is extremely disappointing. The wait times are unbearable, assistance is lacking, and getting a gift wrapped during Christmas is a frustrating ordeal. Even after leaving my items at the store for gift wrapping, they were not touched when I returned after nearly two hours. The staff completely disregarded my time constraints, causing me to miss a gift-giving opportunity. Today's poor experience has led me to decide that I will no longer shop at this location. I will cancel my card, switch to online shopping, and avoid visiting the store whenever possible. It's truly unfortunate.",
    "The staff includes friendly and helpful ladies, although one may be unfriendly if provoked. It becomes evident quickly. Just a heads up.",
    "\"Hendricks in St. Louis is a must-try for barbecue lovers. The meats, sauces, and sides surpass other barbecue places. The onion rings are huge and the coleslaw is delicious and finely shredded. The service is friendly and efficient. Although it takes a while to get the meal, the unique decor is worth exploring during the wait.\"",
    "We had a great experience at this restaurant with a good variety of food for a late night dinner with kids. The person who served us was friendly and helpful. Our waiter, Eric, went above and beyond with outstanding service, making our dining experience memorable. The staff at the grill house station showed thoughtfulness and accommodated our allergy request without hesitation. We wish there was a similar restaurant near us in upper PA.",
    "This coffee spot didn't meet my expectations. No menu and a lack of coffee options made me hesitant. I ordered an iced tea but received hot tea with a cup of ice. The artsy crowd was interesting for people-watching, but not conducive to studying due to the loud atmosphere. Despite friendly servers and regular table cleaning, it wasn't a standout experience that would make me a regular customer.",
    "I highly recommend visiting Milk and Honey! Shoutout to Kyle, who was an amazing and chill waiter. He deserves a raise for his excellent service. The honey hot sauce he recommended was the best I've had in ages. The biscuits were heavenly, even though I stole one from my friend. Definitely come here and ask for Kyle. I miss him and hope to be reunited soon.",
    "Went to this Philadelphia pub before a show in the University City area. Convenient location near the train station and Drexel University with street parking available nearby. Service was satisfactory for dinner. Mac and cheese appetizer had a nice crunchy topping, but taste was average. Cheesesteak egg rolls were decent, although lacking in meat. Accompanied by ketchup and a flavorful mustard with horseradish. The chicken pot pie had ample vegetables and all white meat, but not a lot of chicken. Crust was mostly flaky, but one section seemed undercooked. Desserts were generous in size. Bread pudding was average and served with vanilla ice cream. Brownie was dry and lacked flavor, but may be subjective to personal taste.",
    "I attended a bachelorette party here on a Saturday night in April. Arrive early to avoid the long line. The cover band is amazing, and there were many other celebratory groups. Signature cocktails are good but expensive. Ideal for bachelorette parties or birthdays, but crowded on regular nights.",
    "The best fall off the bone BBQ I've ever had! Pulled pork had a perfect smoky flavor, and the mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. Fast and friendly service. The walnut brownie and ice cream dessert was delightful. A great find!",
    "I had a disappointing experience at Copabanana during restaurant week. The outdoor seating was disturbed by noisy kids playing football, even after we moved. The food was subpar, with overcooked steak and stale mashed potatoes. The only positive was the friendly waitress, but even she couldn't salvage the experience. I won't be returning. 1 star for the waitress.",
    "The shrimp and grits at this place are unbeatable, and the fresh juices complement the meal perfectly. Even after two visits in two years, my fiance still believes it's the best he's ever had.",
    "Finally! A gem in Nashville for tapas! The staff is friendly and the open kitchen adds to the ambiance. The food is absolutely delicious. Can't wait to return and explore more of their menu.",
    "Awesome seafood, no fuss, and the sourdough bread was delicious! The cherry on top was the fantastic 80s music playing in the background.",
    "Dr. Curtis Dechant provides exceptional care with a friendly attitude, creating a positive patient-doctor relationship. The office is comfortable and equipped with the latest technology, making eye appointments more pleasant. The eyeglass frame selection and accommodating staff are also noteworthy.",
    "Overall, the place is cute with great food and a fantastic pear cider beer. The service was excellent, the ambiance was delightful, and the prices were reasonable.",
    "Seasons is a delightful little restaurant primarily known for its delicious desserts. However, they also offer modernized versions of traditional classics as main courses. The shaved ice at Seasons is unique and their variety of boba tea is excellent. The store is conveniently located with ample parking and a clean, modern, and kid-friendly atmosphere. The service is always friendly, fast, and efficient. While I cannot personally vouch for the food, my boyfriend raves about the quail and our friends love the chicken wings. Overall, I highly recommend visiting Seasons for a satisfying and enjoyable dining experience.",
    "The place is cute for meeting friends, but overpriced. Personally, I prefer my own homemade coffee. Adorable concept, but products and prices need improvement.",
    "This place is simply amazing! With 75 cent oysters that I couldn't resist, I indulged in 2 dozen before moving on to their delicious cheesy grits. Truly a great spot for dining, especially during happy hour.",
    "Highly recommend this place! Love the organic, fresh, and delicious food. Variety of options and love that they support local farmers and fishermen. Carly's breakfast is a favorite with avocado, sourdough toast, fried egg, and sweet potatoes. Sooo good!",
    "The burgers at this place are delicious and flavorful, especially the El Mariachi. The portion size might be small, but the taste makes up for it. I highly recommend trying the salted caramel ice cream, it has a great homemade style. Don't forget to add the rooster sauce for an extra kick!",
    "I had an amazing experience at this place! The sushi was surprisingly delicious and the bill was unbelievably low. For just $13, I devoured a plate full of sushi. The staff was not only friendly, but also seemed to enjoy their work. I had a great time and will definitely be returning soon.",
    "This place is terrible. The hoagies are greasy and made me nauseous. The buffalo chicken sandwich was covered in too much blue cheese and greasy sauce, which was disgusting. All the food is overly greasy and over seasoned, they need to use fresher ingredients. The desserts are bland and not worth the money. The sodas are usually expired and flat. Overall, I hate everything about this place.",
    "Despite paying for a non-smoking room, we were disappointed to find a smell and ashtrays in the room. The slow-draining shower and lumpy pillows were also uncomfortable, resulting in a migraine. On a positive note, the room was clean and the staff was friendly. However, the promised free WiFi didn't connect.",
    "The pharmacy staff was unfriendly and provided inconsistent information about prescription wait times. Not recommended if you're in a hurry; consider going to Walmart next door instead.",
    "I love the seitan dishes at El Camino, like the wings and nachos. However, the service can be extremely slow. They once took so long to bring out my nachos that they gave them to me for free. The fried pickles, on the other hand, were disappointing. The coating was too grainy and the taste didn't appeal to me. Despite these drawbacks, the delicious seitan and decent margaritas keep me returning to El Camino.",
    "I highly recommend B13 for tattoos. I've had two done there and both turned out amazing. The owner was able to accommodate a group of us on short notice with an impressive design. Amanda's work is particularly outstanding, although the entire team is fantastic.",
    "Went on a busy Friday night with a 20 min wait. Service was hit and miss, though the server tried their best. Food was okay, but not impressive. Unlikely to return, it just didn't stand out.",
    "I highly recommend Twisted Twig for all your floral needs. Jen provides excellent service, is very friendly, and creates amazing arrangements. She worked within my budget and delivered exactly what I wanted for my wedding. I was pleasantly surprised by her attention to detail and the extra touches she added to make everything perfect. You will not be disappointed working with Jen at Twisted Twig.",
    "Overall, the restaurant had some great dishes like the seaweed salad, shiomay, and sashimi which were fresh and delicious. However, the service was lacking as our waiter was unfriendly and made assumptions about our order. While the banzai roll was unique and tasty, the salad dressing tasted more like carrot pur\u00e9e. One star was deducted due to the subpar service.",
    "I recently discovered this hidden gem for brunch and was blown away. Despite living so close, I had never heard of it before. The honeybee crepe and almond croissant were absolutely delicious, leaving nothing for leftovers. The seating area is cozy, but it's best to arrive early if you're with a group. Perfect for smaller groups and I will definitely be returning.",
    "Best location ever! Donuts are made to order, and after 5pm they are always super hot and incredibly tasty. Even the next day, they remain delicious.",
    "Highly recommended! This place is adorable and sustainable. The staff is amazing, and the food and coffee are extraordinary.",
    "Horrible food quality and overpriced, coupled with a frustrating two-hour delivery time and rude customer service over the phone. Regrettable choice to order from this establishment, definitely won't be repeating the experience.",
    "I absolutely love Evan! He is the best guy ever and the reason I come to OMALLZ.",
    "Disappointing experience - tasteless burger, soggy bun, and overly salty fries. Overpriced for the quality. Won't return.",
    "I was pleasantly surprised to discover a Taiwanese restaurant in Reno, conveniently located near all of the hotels. The boba tea was solid, and they offer authentic Taiwanese food choices if you know what to order.",
    "This restaurant is a complete disappointment and not worth your money. Despite dining here twice, we've had such terrible experiences that corporate had to refund us. It's clear that this place is clueless and you will only be ripped off.",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Despite my initial hesitation as a vegetarian, they offer a delicious veggie burger and a great variety of local microbrews. Don't miss out on their homemade ice cream! I'll definitely be returning when I'm in St. Louis again.",
    "Zaika is a hidden gem for Indian food lovers. The fresh ingredients and attention to detail in their dishes set them apart from other Indo-Pak places. The Paneer is silky and flavorful, and even their vegetarian options are so delicious that you won't miss the meat. The appetizers are well-spiced and reminiscent of homemade meals. The naan is perfectly cooked, though it lacks the faint sweetness it's known for. The extensive menu makes ordering easy, and their catering services are highly praised. Overall, Zaika offers a delightful dining experience, and their Ras Malai dessert is a must-try.",
    "This bustling restaurant exceeded our expectations with its special coffee, attentive service, accommodating for dietary restrictions, and delectable dishes. The presentation and pricing were both satisfactory. We highly recommend this restaurant.",
    "I highly recommend this place! The staff is incredibly friendly and great with kids. The food, especially the hash browns, is amazing. You can also try their delicious tomatoes and grits on the side. Best of all, it's budget-friendly.",
    "The gelato at this place is delicious, but the service is extremely poor. During my recent visit with a friend from out of town, we encountered unprofessional behavior from the night staff, which made my friend feel uncomfortable. Even the young manager did not improve the situation. The service used to be great here, but something appears to have gone wrong recently.",
    "Fantastic location for outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and running with well-maintained paths, stunning views, and shady spots. However, the only drawback is people not adhering to the dogs on leash rule, with at least 6 off-leash dogs encountered. It's crucial to follow the rules; otherwise, they might ban dogs altogether.",
    "I highly recommend this place! The crab cake appetizer was delicious with a refreshing dill sauce. The chicken tenders were generous in portion and satisfying. The service was fine, although it can get busy at times. The prices were unbelievably reasonable. The ambiance is nice and overall, it's a lovely option for great food at a reasonable price.",
    "Outstanding service, delicious food & friendly staff. Constant promotions keep us coming back. Incredible fish quality & well-proportioned rolls allow for diverse selection. Our go-to sushi spot in town!",
    "My boyfriend and I tried Jesse's for the first time and had a great experience. Despite being busy, we were seated quickly by the window. The server, Nikki, was prompt and knowledgeable. The appetizers and soups were tasty, although the crab stuffed mushrooms were small. The Caesar salads were good and the pacing of the meal was perfect. The steaks were cooked perfectly, but there weren't enough saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Overall, Nikki's service was fantastic and we definitely plan to return.",
    "The staff was friendly, the selection was good, and the prices were fair.",
    "I had a disappointing experience at The Praline Connection in New Orleans. The BBQ Oysters were served in a soup cup with a bland \"BBQ sauce\" and had a gooey texture. The garlic bread tasted stale and frozen, and the appetizers were cold and appeared microwaved. The Chicken wings were undercooked, cold, and had an unpleasant sauce. The rest of our party also found their entrees unsatisfactory. The only positives were the great service and the clean, pleasant ambiance. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",
    "This McDonald's location near my home is terrible. The food is consistently bad, cold, or incorrect. The service is slow, and many employees do not speak English, making communication difficult. I recommend avoiding this location unless you have plenty of time and can speak Spanish.",
    "The breakfast was outstanding, conveniently located near our hotel. The crepes with fruit were delicious and definitely worth ordering again. However, the tea had a slight taste of fennel seed, which could be a hit or miss for some.",
    "Attended a Yelp Elite event at Holy Mole and had an amazing time! The food was incredible, especially the specially crafted cocktail. The staff was attentive and friendly. Can't wait to come back for a full meal!",
    "My experience at Dinardo's was unpleasant and disappointing. The interior was run down and unclean, and the food quality did not match the high prices. The server made snarky comments, which added to the unwelcome atmosphere. The mussels were small and the sauce was unimpressive, while other dishes were bland and salty. I would recommend trying seafood elsewhere, as there are better options available. I am surprised that this place is still in business.",
    "Starbucks is a great guilty pleasure with friendly baristas, delicious drinks, and tasty pastries. The drive-thru line is long, but going in to order is quicker. Highly recommended!",
    "We absolutely loved this diner! Charming decor, delicious food, especially the cheese steak which surpassed Geno's. The server was fantastic.",
    "JB Dawson's exceeded expectations, with a friendly hostess, attentive servers, and delicious food. The twisted shrimp appetizer was better than a popular competitor's version. The Four Cheese Mac & Cheese and fish tacos were both tasty, and the asparagus was perfectly cooked. The only drawback was the limited craft beer menu, but the waiter kindly offered a suitable alternative. Overall, a great experience, though I may bring my own craft beer next time.",
    "Stopped here for lunch on the way to the airport and was pleasantly surprised. The Greek salad was hands down the best I've ever had, with fresh ingredients and perfect dressing. The vegetarian plate was equally delicious, with flavorful pan-fried vegetables and a satisfying portion size. Great value for money.",
    "I highly recommend this local pho shop with a loyal clientele. The food is great, the staff is very nice, and the ingredients are fresh. Stop in and try their delicious dishes! 5 stars.",
    "The food is amazing, and the atmosphere is great. The carne asada tacos take me back home.",
    "Disappointing service overshadowed the amazing beer selection. Will not be returning. Instead, try Brickside Grill for great beer, delicious food, and friendly staff.",
    "This Mexican restaurant on Main Street is average in terms of food and drinks. The pulled pork tacos and burrito were decent but nothing exceptional. It has a college-like atmosphere, so consider that before visiting.",
    "Delicious Designs and Leigh Anne exceeded all expectations for my last-minute wedding cake request. The simple two-tier lemon cake was beautifully made and surpassed my imagination. Leigh Anne even accommodated my daughter's vegan preference with delicious chocolate cupcakes. The cake was not only perfect but also incredibly tasty. Highly recommend Leigh Anne for any bakery needs in Reno!",
    "I have been a customer at this nail salon for years, but recent experiences have been disappointing. When my regular technician left, I tried a new technician, Angela, but the gel polish she applied started chipping within a day. Despite her efforts to fix it, the problem persisted. Now my nails are in poor condition, and I don't have confidence in Angela's ability to correct the issue. Unfortunately, I will have to find a new nail salon. Overall, very upsetting and disappointing.",
    "Terrible dining experience at Sake House! Extremely slow service and incorrect orders. Neglected my requests for water and took forever to bring my son's food. Lack of attention and poor customer service. I wasted two hours here and had to leave unsatisfied with a hungry toddler. Avoid this place, there are better options available.",
    "The stage setup and atmosphere are impressive, with a raised stage, moving lights, good sound system, fog machine, and a spacious dance floor. Unfortunately, the food service is subpar, with poor experiences both times I visited. On my last visit, I wasn't greeted at the entrance and had to find a table myself. When I asked for a menu, I was informed that the kitchen had already closed, despite it being just 10 minutes before the stated closing time. To top it off, I watched the same staff member seat and serve other customers who arrived after me. This lack of service was frustrating and rude.",
    "Jenna Moore is amazing! I have been trying to achieve an A-line bob for over a year with little success, until today. She listened to everything I had to say, ensured that we were on the same page, and delivered exactly what I wanted. I know my hair still needs some healing and growth, but I can actually see my desired look in the future now, thanks to Jenna. Highly, highly recommended!",
    "Fast, fresh, with very good carne and guacamole. However, limited ability to customize taco toppings and thick tortilla chips were a letdown. The dulche de leche soft serve ice cream was amazingly delicious. However, more seating and improved table clean-ups would be beneficial.",
    "CURED Salon is a hidden gem in Nashville with impeccable style. The upscale polish options and prompt service exceeded my expectations. The clean and sterilized tools added to the overall experience. The salon has a classic and comfortable vibe, perfect for special occasions or a relaxing day with friends. Competitive prices and convenient location make it a great addition to the neighborhood. Can't wait to return!",
    "I have been a loyal patron of this place for years, and despite living in Colorado now, I make it a point to visit whenever I'm in Philadelphia for work. The menu offers a variety of delicious options, with generous portions and affordable prices. My personal favorite is the Indian Mee Goreng, it's so amazing that I wish I could eat it every day. Perhaps one day I'll be lucky enough to get the recipe from the manager so I can enjoy it even when I'm in CO.",
    "Service was excellent, but the pizza did not meet my expectations. Won't be returning.",
    "I stayed at this hotel for one week after Christmas. Unless you book adjoining rooms, you'll be disturbed by strangers\u2019 conversations, coughs, clearing throats, fights, and dogs barking as if they are in your bed. Only managed to sleep for two out of seven nights after the hotel cleared out post New Year. The connecting doors are inadequately insulated. The staff at the hotel is exceptional, but Starwood needs to address this issue to improve guests' experience. I have stayed at many places with connecting doors and have never encountered such poor insulation. Possible poor materials used?",
    "Overall, the sandwich I had here was disappointing. The jalape\u00f1o cheese bread lacked flavor and was dry, indicating it was likely old. The tomatoes and cucumbers were mushy and overripe. However, I must mention that the staff was friendly.",
    "We highly recommend this movie theater/bar/restaurant. Excellent drinks, friendly service, and delicious food. Must visit!",
    "The iced mocha and iced white chocolate mocha were both disappointing - they lacked any coffee or chocolate flavor, tasting extremely watered down. Despite requesting an extra shot, they still had no flavor. We were so dissatisfied that we had to throw them away. Extremely disappointing and not worth trying.",
    "This place used to be excellent with a wide selection of items, reasonable prices, and helpful staff. I once returned a faulty part and got a refund without any hassle. Also returned an unnecessary purchase and received a prompt refund. While the quality has declined slightly, it is still a decent establishment.",
    "The New Orleans gem near the bridge on Peters or Piety is a fast favorite. With a 1.25-mile path offering city views, breezes, art installations, a dog park, and a walk along the Mississippi River, it's a beautiful way to end any day in NOLA. Don't miss the chance to catch a spectacular sunset!",
    "I contacted United Van Lines for a moving quote, but received no response after multiple attempts. Their lack of communication and professionalism was disappointing.",
    "The sushi at this place is affordable and the specialty menu is outstanding. The Snow Mountain and Volcano sushi are both remarkable.",
    "This place is THE BEST for gyros! The food quality is amazing, especially the chicken gyros. They offer a variety of options, including delicious burgers that my daughter adores. The perfectly seasoned steak fries are absolutely amazing - always hot and fresh. However, I personally didn't enjoy the baklava as it's made with pistachios.",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by this place in Reno. The Taiwanese food was excellent, surpassing my expectations. Highly recommend trying the \u4e09\u676f\u9e21, oyster omelet, and scallion pancake. I'm already craving for more dishes and will definitely miss this place when I leave.",
    "The restaurant offers delicious and genuine food in a pleasant and tidy setting. The service provided is commendable. Although the beer options are limited, our overall first visit was fantastic, and we look forward to returning.",
    "I had a wonderful lunch experience at this wine lounge with my fiancee and friend. The small table by the window provided a cozy and intimate atmosphere. The wine selection was impressive and varied, with great options to choose from. We enjoyed a bubbly and Italian orange soda. The \"snacks\" of lamb sausage, potato chips, and crab stuffed peppers were delicious. I particularly loved the mozzarella with prosciutto bacon bits sandwich, which was both flavorful and light. The service was prompt and polite. The rustic ambiance had a low to medium noise level. The only minor issue was the confusing bathroom door lock and handle. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for lunch.",
    "Fellinis of Media is my top pick for dining out! Their extensive menu caters to all tastes, and the friendly staff goes above and beyond to meet your needs. The elegant and serene ambiance adds to the overall experience. In my view, this restaurant offers the finest Italian cuisine in town.",
    "This place is a game changer for the neighborhood! The food is absolutely delicious, and I'm newly smitten by their southern Latin cuisine. The family who owns it is also very sweet. Exactly what the neighborhood needed!",
    "Terrible experience at the Lehigh Acres location. The place is dirty and disorganized, with old newspapers and a dusty fake tree in the waiting area. Jenna did a horrible job on my nails, leading to two return visits in one week. She was rude and argumentative throughout the process. No hope for improvement here, would not recommend.",
    "I had a great experience at the bar with excellent drinks and the best hummus I've ever had. However, the brunch was awful - long wait, cold food, and a hair in it. Despite the manager compensating our check, I would suggest skipping breakfast and only visiting the bar. A disappointment for a Kimpton restaurant.",
    "I love this theater! It's always clean and the staff is friendly. However, it is lacking some necessary updates like upgraded seating and wait staff service that other theaters offer. The pricing is similar to other theaters with perks, but this one needs a complete update throughout.",
    "I recently tried out this Thai restaurant and I would give it 4-5 stars. It was my first visit and I found the food to be delicious. The shrimp spring rolls were especially fresh and the peanut sauce was tasty. The tom yum soup was a bit too spicy for my liking, but still had a good sour flavor. The pad thai and drunken noodle dishes were also enjoyable, although the noodles in the pad thai were a bit overdone. The portions were slightly smaller than other places in the area. The owner was friendly and attentive, even coming outside to talk with me about the food. The restaurant has a cute setup in a quaint house, but it may not be ideal if it's crowded. Overall, I think it's worth a try for Thai food fans. I used a Living Social deal, which made the total bill for two people, including an appetizer, soup, and a drink, to be around $24.",
    "Kingsway Mall is a great alternative to West Ed for shopping with its variety of stores like lululemon, Jacob, Danier, Gap, Club Monaco, and American Eagle. Unlike other malls, it is typically less crowded, making browsing easier. The food options at the mall, such as New York Fries, Orange Julius, and Booster Juice, are also plentiful. The food court is spacious with ample seating available. However, it would be even better if Kingsway had a Bay and a movie theatre. Overall, Kingsway Mall is a satisfactory and convenient shopping destination.",
    "Indias Kitchen was a disappointing experience. The goat curry was excessively salty with an overpowering tomato flavor, and the meat was tough. The naan bread was below average, but the rice was enjoyable. Overall, a very disappointing meal.",
    "Overall, the reviewer thought the restaurant was a little pricey but worth it. The service was initially slow, but improved once they got their menus. The food came quickly and was delicious, with the crab cake and fries being highlights. However, they had to sit in the bar area due to the time and the table was too small. The reviewer also mentioned a payment issue but was assured by the manager that it would be resolved.",
    "I am a sushi snob and this was the worst sushi I've ever had. It was warm and the side salad was just plain iceberg lettuce. I won't be returning.",
    "My partner and I shared the veg platter and left completely satisfied! Mouthwatering dishes, delightful and helpful staff. They assist you in making choices and are trustworthy. We're definitely returning.",
    "I had an extremely disappointing experience at this hotel. While the atmosphere and appearance were classy, the staff was a huge letdown. Despite booking a suite for a bachelorette party, they gave us separate rooms and my friend had to beg for adjacent rooms as they had run out of suites. As a compensation, they offered free valet service. However, the next day we discovered that the valet had keyed my friend's car door while bringing it from the parking garage. This was without a doubt the worst hotel experience, and I will definitely not be returning.",
    "I frequent this place often and it never fails to impress! Recently, my friend and I visited while traveling to Puerto Rico, and my mother-in-law had a craving for Tamales. The staff graciously provided free samples and even offered to cook and pack them for us. Exceptional place with friendly service!",
    "Regret not reading the reviews beforehand. Long wait for mediocre food. The rowdy bar crowd made the atmosphere uncomfortable. Doubt this place will survive.",
    "I enjoyed the experience eating here and will definitely go back. They have vegetarian options on the menu, and the veggie spring rolls were hot, crisp, and delicious. The duck and rice vermicelli soup was great, with a yummy, savory broth. However, I didn't care for the beef pho due to grisly meat and the presence of tripe, but I should have chosen a different beef cut. The regular serving size was generous, and the atmosphere was clean and quiet with an interesting 80s decor. The server was quick and attentive.",
    "Chickie's and Pete's is a women-friendly sports bar with plenty of seating for Sunday games. The sound booth in the sky adds a nice touch of entertainment during commercials. The smoke-free environment is a plus. However, the famous crab fries didn't live up to expectations due to the congealed cheese sauce and lukewarm temperature. On the bright side, the towers of beer with taps add a fun element. Overall, Chickie's and Pete's is a great spot to enjoy a game, thanks to its spacious layout, energetic atmosphere, and attractive servers.",
    "Pancake Pantry in Nashville is a must-visit institution. With the chance to spot country stars and enjoy a delicious breakfast, their pancakes are a definite highlight. Be prepared for a wait, but the vibrant conversations make it worth it. A truly essential Nashville experience.",
    "Magasin Kitchen has satisfied my longing for delicious Vietnamese cuisine while Magasin Cafe undergoes renovations. The food and service here are commendable, with even the chopped garnishing surpassing its counterpart. Although the higher price tag and the ambiance of the restaurant may be discouraging, the exceptional quality of the food and service ensures my continued loyalty.",
    "This place is my go-to. Whether it's their cumin style lamb or rabbit appetizer, everything tastes amazing. While some may question its authenticity, I've only experienced true Sichuan flavors in Chengdu. Regardless, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit.",
    "Kmart lacks in quality and selection, particularly in electronics and movies. The store's atmosphere is unimpressive and attempts at creating a department store experience fall flat. However, they offer good deals on patio furniture during off seasons and clearance days. The pharmacy receives credit for efficient service and convenient hours. Overall, Kmart remains subpar and may appeal to a niche group of shoppers.",
    "The Tuck Special at this Nashville establishment is worth a long drive from Texas just to savor it again. The blend of unconventional ingredients like brisket, egg, and pimento cheese creates an incredible flavor. While my husband wasn't fond of the BBQ sauce, the meat itself was quite satisfying. This place can get crowded, but with a little patience and menu research beforehand, it should be manageable.",
    "The restaurant had a terrible odor resembling a toilet. I couldn't tolerate it and opted for takeout. Unfortunately, the server packed mine and my daughter's meals together, and she doesn't eat fish. While I ordered a spicy tuna roll, it turned out to be average at best. However, my daughter did enjoy her meal. Considering these experiences, I won't be returning to this sushi restaurant.",
    "Overall, I absolutely love the food at this place. The portions are generous, and the menu is constantly evolving, which keeps things interesting. However, I do have a few concerns - the seating is cramped and the noise level makes conversation difficult. Additionally, the coffee could be improved to match the quality of Sabrina's. Nevertheless, I must say that the latkas are consistently perfect and the bacon stands out as the best I've had in Philly.",
    "Yellow Subs in Reno is a must-visit! The sprouts on the sub are a game changer. The staff is friendly, down to earth, and the sub options are top-notch. I highly recommend this place to all sub and food lovers. Their tank tops and t-shirts are awesome too. I'll definitely be coming back. 5 stars for the fast service, amazing food, and lively atmosphere.",
    "Overall, Tina, our waitress, provided satisfactory service, but the initial wait time was long. I am torn between giving 3 or 4 stars. However, the food was delicious, especially for a first-time experience. I also enjoyed the side salad.",
    "Love this place! It's become our go-to spot. The atmosphere is always great, food is delicious, and drinks are amazing. The salsa is incredibly tasty, and don't miss out on the generously-sized salads. Perfect for chilling with friends on the outdoor seating while sipping margaritas. Highly recommend!",
    "The service was great but the food was just okay. The soups should have been served warmer and my steak was overcooked, despite requesting it to be medium. Nevertheless, the service was excellent.",
    "Despite its positive reviews, Nippon Tei didn't quite impress me. While the free edamame was a nice touch, the mango sake drink was overpriced and just okay. The sushi rolls were tasty, but I've had better elsewhere. The main downside was that the rolls kept falling apart, which affected both presentation and the overall experience. Although I might return in the future, I already have preferred sushi spots. The prices were average, so that won't be a factor in attracting me back. Time will tell.",
    "I had a disappointing experience watching Star Wars Rogue One in 3D at this theater. The ticket purchase and atmosphere were good, and the food was delicious. However, the screen was extremely dark, making it difficult to see the actors' faces. Even the 3D glasses didn't help, as the shadows in the background were double. The manager was unhelpful and refused to acknowledge the issue. I won't be returning for their 3D showings.",
    "Overpriced for average and lukewarm food, with servers who struggled with dish names and seemed in a rush to get rid of us. Questionable pricing for dishes not listed on the menu. One server didn't understand a comment about the food and ignored it. The \"ropa vieja\" dish was decent but came in a small portion for the price. The menu prices didn't match the poor ambiance with plastic containers and a sagging knitted item overhead.",
    "Overall, disappointed with the restaurant. Interesting layout resembling a chicken coop, but the food was overpriced and underwhelming. Only decent value was the chicken strips and fries from the Sunday brunch menu. Seasonal salad was laughably small and lacking lettuce, yet expensive. Chicken was good, but not better than Raising Canes. Slow service and food despite a small crowd.",
    "Wow! This place is amazing! I'm not a vegetarian or health-conscious, but I absolutely love it. Thanks to a persuasive co-worker, I tried it once and now I'm hooked. The delicious salads and friendly service keep me coming back. Even though I don't order daily, I constantly crave their food. Highly recommended!",
    "I had a terrible experience at Regis Hair salon with stylist Angie. She completely butchered my haircut despite showing her photos of the style I wanted. Even when I pointed out her mistakes, she didn't pay attention. I ended up with a men's flattop instead. This was extremely disappointing, and I will never return to this salon again. Thanks for ruining my holiday season, Angie and Regis Hair salon.",
    "Perfect place for a date night with delicious food, especially the sweet potato nachos and breakfast options. Can't wait to go back!",
    "We recently dined at Convivio right after its opening and will definitely return. Despite some minor service issues and wine being out of stock, which can be expected for a new establishment, the owner's visit to our table was incredibly pleasant. The food was exceptional, particularly the tortelloni pansotti, possibly the best pasta I've had. We will certainly be regular patrons.",
    "I stumbled upon Crabby Bill's after a long day at the beach and craving seafood. The $25 bucket of steamed seafood was decent, but not the freshest. It served as a quick snack to hold us over before our dinner reservation at Bern's Steak House.",
    "State Street Kitchen never fails to impress with their creative and delicious dishes. The Grilled Chicken, Spinach, Swiss and Honey Mustard Sub with Jalapeno Chips added a perfect spicy crunch. Whether it's for breakfast or lunch, this local gem is my go-to spot. Don't miss out on their unique Korean-inspired home cooking - make sure you find a way to experience it for yourself and become part of their welcoming family.",
    "This place is amazing! The food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and they have rotating specials. Everything is homemade, and what more can you ask for? Don't miss out on their chicken salad, perfect for making sandwiches at home.",
    "I had a disappointing experience at this restaurant mainly due to the poor service. While the food was good, the staff member who took my order was rude and unhelpful. Despite being referred by the front desk of my hotel, I was told that the hospitality discount was only available to front desk employees. The staff member reluctantly applied the discount after some arguing. Overall, I was shocked by the lack of professionalism and will not be returning.",
    "Always a delightful experience! Quick appointments with minimal wait time and the ladies are always sweet.",
    "Despite good cocktails and a nice atmosphere, we were disappointed with the food. The Brussel sprouts and fries tasted like pure salt, even after replacement. The burger was just okay and the flank steak was nothing special. We won't be returning.",
    "I absolutely love Phillies games and this stadium enhances the experience. Despite my initial 10,000th loss, the open atmosphere avoids feeling claustrophobic. The only inconvenience was sitting beneath the scoreboard. I appreciate the ability to roam around while still having a great view of the game. The wide variety of delicious food and clean facilities also contribute to a positive experience. I'm eagerly awaiting baseball season to cheer on the Phillies!",
    "I recently had lunch at this Mexican restaurant with my boyfriend. The beans were absolutely amazing, the salsa was fresh and cilantro forward, and the chips were thick and crunchy. However, the portion size was disappointing and chips and salsa had to be purchased separately. The chunky guacamole was the highlight, but the meat in the steak tacos was low quality and lacking in flavor. Despite this, my boyfriend is willing to try it again.",
    "Plaza Deli in La Cumbre Plaza is my go-to place for delicious and fresh sandwiches. Their bread rolls are superb \u2013 soft and not too crusty. As a long-time Santa Barbara resident, I've been visiting this spot for years and have never been disappointed. Their wide variety of sandwiches makes it challenging to choose a favorite. Don't forget to try their excellent soda selection. While Plaza Deli may not offer extravagant options, it's the perfect place for locals and visitors alike seeking a fantastic sandwich made with quality ingredients.",
    "The Nordstrom's shoe department at this location exceeds others with its vast variety and inclusion of higher end lines. The sales professionals, particularly Erwin, demonstrated exceptional service by locating and price matching to a competitor's sale price with free shipping. Nordstrom's has definitely earned my loyalty with their remarkable customer service.",
    "The small aquarium in Tarpon Springs is primarily geared towards kids and offers a shark feeding show as well as the opportunity to pet stingrays and feed them. Although it might not be my first choice of attractions in the area, it is decent enough, especially for young children who seem to enjoy it.",
    "This place is the go-to spot for simple and satisfying Chinese takeout. The food is less greasy than usual and the staff is incredibly friendly.",
    "I absolutely loved this quaint place! The ambience, food, and service were all fantastic. I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy, which was incredibly delicious. The fries and cole slaw served as perfect side dishes. It was my first visit, but certainly won't be my last!",
    "Overall, my experience at Broussard's was good. The ambiance in the foyer and courtyard was old-school and beautiful, perfect for some touristy pictures. The service was prompt and efficient, with the waiter successfully suggesting a substitute for the Pinot Grigio I ordered. The Maytag blue cheese salad and pecan crusted drum were delicious, though I wish there was more salad. However, the dining room itself was in need of an upgrade, as the chandeliers resembled those in my grandmother's assisted living home. While it was a good experience, I don't think I'll be returning. [3 stars]",
    "The service is excellent, the atmosphere is great, and the raw bar with Alaskan crab legs is fantastic. The burgers are everything my friends hoped for, but be prepared to splurge, as other entrees are quite pricey. The shrimp and grits with crab were not as heavenly as the waiter claimed, and the price was unreasonable. However, the drinks and appetizers are delicious, and the complimentary cool pizza appetizer and rabbit and chicken liver pate are worth trying. Stick to drinks, appetizers, and burgers for a happy dining experience.",
    "Doan's is fantastic! Consistently great, friendly staff, and fast service. Perfect for a quick lunch!",
    "This brick oven pizza joint keeps improving with every visit. I can't get enough of their Rotolo, a doughy delight filled with mortadella, ricotta cheese, pistachios, and oil. It's a must-order each time, priced at $5 and the size of a bun. The prosciutto pizza is incredibly flavorful, with divine dough. The service is consistently excellent, and the beer selection is commendable. Easily one of Philly's best pizza spots.",
    "This pizza is the real deal - thick, chewy, cheesy, and just how pizza is meant to taste! It's the best I've had since moving to Indianapolis and I've finally found my new pizza home.",
    "Extremely disappointing experience waiting 27 minutes for three teas in an empty store. Unacceptable wait time, particularly in Chinatown where efficiency is expected.",
    "The beef sandwiches here rival the best in Chicago. However, a larger size option, sweet peppers, fries, extended hours, and year-round availability at the main location would take it to the next level.",
    "I highly recommend Buff for a relaxing and accommodating nail salon experience. The modern and minimalist decor creates a clean and pleasant atmosphere. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our group for 4 pedicures, even adding an extra pedicurist to the schedule. The complimentary drinks, including mimosas, wine, and champagne, are a delightful touch. The service was friendly and welcoming, and my polish lasted without chipping. The only downside is street parking only, but it shouldn't be an issue for regular customers. Overall, I will definitely be returning to Buff.",
    "Excellent pho spot in Philly. The broth is amazing, and even the small portion (No. 51) was satisfyingly filling. Will definitely return when I'm in town.",
    "I absolutely love this concept! The caf\u00e9 serves an impressive range of coffees, teas, and breakfast items, while the other half offers delicious bar-style apps, salads, and sandwiches. The wide variety of beers available on tap, bottled, or in can is a major plus. This casual spot is perfect for spending hours with friends, reminiscent of the good ol' college days. And the best part? You can bring your furry friend along, as they are more than welcome here.",
    "My husband and I reserved a Corolla-sized car online, but requested an upgrade to a Camry at Avis Rent A Car in Reno. After some discussion, we received the Camry we wanted. The staff was professional, but the rental price of $800 for five days seemed high. We had already purchased insurance for $150. The car itself was great during our vacation. However, upon dropping off the car, we found out that a weekly rate would have been just $15 more. The upgrade had cost us an extra $20 per day. I will not rent from Avis again, opting for Hertz or Dollar and making phone reservations instead. In hindsight, the extra insurance was unnecessary as my personal insurance covers everything.",
    "Excellent customer service! Absolutely thrilled with my new car purchase. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a well-maintained used car. Andy provided exceptional assistance and made the buying process seamless.",
    "Jungle Prada Tavern exceeded my expectations! The bartender's beer recommendation was spot-on, and their seafood dishes, from the scallops prosciutto to the del mar pizza, were outstanding. The crab-stuffed portabella with a side of crab and lobster bisque was a definite highlight. Even as a vegetarian, I thoroughly enjoyed the roasted portabella app. I've returned multiple times, bringing my seafood-loving sister along, and we both left satisfied. Don't hesitate to give this place a try - you won't be disappointed with the variety of options available!",
    "I absolutely love this bead store in Nashville! It has an amazing selection of seed beads and glass strands. The walls are filled with an incredible variety. Highly recommended!",
    "Had an amazing dinner experience on opening day! The atmosphere was great, staff was lovely, and the food was on point. The green tea (PHO PHREE) was so satisfying, summer rolls with spicy peanut sauce were delicious, and the pho was phenomenal. Adding this spot to my regular eating destinations in Fairmount!",
    "Despite its outdated appearance, this place offers surprisingly delicious food that will remind you of grandma's cooking. The 1950's decor adds a charming small-town vibe, complete with ice skates on the wall and a Christmas tree in the corner. While it may not offer the best food in the world, their breakfast dishes are consistently amazing. The pancakes are fluffy and light, especially when topped with a bit of butter. The bacon is thick and tasty, albeit slightly overcooked. With reasonable prices and excellent service, this is the perfect spot for a satisfying homemade breakfast.",
    "Disappointing experience due to limited menu, unaccommodating server, and poor service. Overpriced food for the quality. Unlikely to return unless there's a compelling reason.",
    "This place is a must-visit! Second visit surpassed expectations. Butternut squash and goat cheese Rangoons and mushroom yakisoba were deliciously filling with amazing flavor. Coconut curry ramen was heavenly. Only complaint is the lack of bar seating without feeling in the servers' way. Worth the wait before a theater visit. Quick service ensured we made it to the show with happy tummies.",
    "The beer at this place was good, but not amazing. The location is a bit isolated and industrial, lacking in scenery. However, they do offer a discount on beer when a train passes by. I would give it a 3.5-star rating. Despite the location, it was still popular with a loyal following on a Sunday afternoon.",
    "I initially had a great experience at this salon with a \"Mini Manicure\". The nail technician did an amazing job and the polish lasted without chipping. The staff were friendly and the salon had a trendy and peaceful vibe. However, my second visit for a gel manicure was disappointing. The technician did not have the proper brush for a French manicure and used a q-tip instead, resulting in uneven lines and poorly shaped nails. The appointment took longer than expected and I was late for work. I'm conflicted about returning and may need to find another salon to fix the issues before my upcoming trip.",
    "This hidden gem in the Marigny is a must-visit for those willing to venture off the tourist path. While not perfect, this affordable spot offers delicious food with the convenience of an all-day breakfast menu. Vegetarian and vegan options are available, although the concept of cheese in these dishes seems questionable. The French fry po'boy, mac 'n cheese sandwiches, and Saturday Blue Plate BBQ Chicken legs are outstanding. With every entree under $10 and $5 Bloody Mary's that are worth it, why complain?",
    "The sangria is awesome, and the rotating craft beers are a great addition. The delightful combination of pizza, calzones, and drinks keep me coming back for more.",
    "Overall, this bar and casino combo offers a decent alcohol selection and well-mixed drinks. However, the higher than average prices and limited food menu, which also made me sick, were disappointing. The poor service mentioned in other reviews was unfortunately true, as we had to repeatedly track down our server. Given the many better options in Reno, this place is not my preferred choice.",
    "Terrible service! The staff was rude, unprofessional, and unhelpful. When I inquired about availability for Thanksgiving, they abruptly said no and rudely ended the call. I will definitely be looking for another place to take my business.",
    "I visited this place with a gift card and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious food. I tried the sauteed stir fry over spinach while my girlfriend enjoyed the abundant pile of nachos. The menu had a nice variety of options, and the bartender during our visit was friendly. I would recommend this sports bar for those seeking a welcoming atmosphere, good food, and a chance to watch sports on TV.",
    "Terrible experience. Soggy and cold pizza delivered after 2 hours with zero communication. Promised refund, but still charged. Terrible service, extremely rude. Avoid at all costs. Don't order from here.",
    "The service and food at this restaurant are incredible! The black bean ravioli and bone-in steak were succulent, flavorful, and juicy. The staff, from the hostess to the chef, made us feel at home. The beautiful ambiance added to the experience. Highly recommended for groups of four or more.",
    "Timeout Pub and Sports Bar does not live up to the hype. The interior lacks authenticity and the music choice is questionable. They have a full bar with specialty drinks, but the atmosphere needs improvement. The food is typical sports bar fare, nothing too exciting. Happy hours are available, but overall, it's not worth the visit compared to the neighboring Legends Sports Bar.",
    "Highly recommend their onion rings - some of the best I've ever had! The Reuben sandwich was also delicious.",
    "The cutest and friendliest coffee shop in Boise! Amazing coffee, but the staff is the real highlight. Love this place!",
    "My hubby and I had high expectations for this place based on a friend's recommendation. We arrived at 8pm, only to find the open sign turned off. Despite seeing people inside, we were greeted with confusion and told they were closed. It was an uncomfortable experience and left us unsure if we'll ever give it another shot.",
    "The food at this place is awesome! Fresh and delicious, especially the papaya salad and the spicy curry. The service was great, and they also offer take-out. Highly recommend!",
    "I recently tried Music City Dental after getting new dental insurance. Dr. Spurlin and her staff are amazing! They were gentle and ensured my comfort throughout the whole visit. Despite my fear of shots, I barely felt anything when Dr. Spurlin administered one for my filling. They even offered me a pillow, blanket, and the choice to watch a movie or listen to music. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I will be returning as a permanent patient!",
    "The beef noodles and fried rice were a bit salty and oily, but still good overall. The shrimp spring rolls were excellent, one of the best we've had. However, due to a chaotic seating arrangement and the owner's oversight, we can only give it three stars.",
    "Burger Up has a fantastic community vibe, where I've made friends and had interesting conversations. Being within walking distance of my house is a bonus. The classic burger is delicious, made from homemade buns and ketchup with a unique taste. The bar offers a wide selection, including creative homemade drinks like the watermelon concoction I had last night. Ignore the negative reviews, they seem driven by personal grudges rather than genuine criticism. Burger Up represents Nashville's diverse community and I appreciate their efforts. If you expect a cookie-cutter experience, this may not be the right place for you.",
    "Despite not typically enjoying Indian food, this place exceeded my expectations. Let Hassan decide your order to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the menu. Don't miss the delicious chaat and lassi combination, they perfectly complement each other.",
    "The food at Mr. B was excellent, especially the shrimp and grits and barbecued shrimp. The appetizers were enjoyable as well. The bread pudding was slightly disappointing, being dry in a city known for it. The service was good but could have been more attentive. The location is great, although the restaurant was uncomfortably cold in July, so be prepared to wear long sleeves or bring a jacket.",
    "Highly recommend the Steamboat Natchez trip in NOLA. Extremely informative and enjoyable, with great service from the well-organized staff. JoJo went above and beyond to reserve us a window seat. Overall, a very pleasant experience.",
    "This business has a potentially disastrous business model if not for its dedicated clientele. During my visits to New Orleans, I have found amusement in betting on how many beers or ingredients they would be out of. The bartenders are rude and prone to swearing. It's almost comical to witness patrons requesting draft beers or mixed drinks only to be told \"can't do that.\" Today, I observed at least five people being denied \"mules\" as we sat for about 30 minutes. Additionally, two out of their four taps were not even working. What a missed opportunity.",
    "Mixed experience at Mr. B's. Good start at the bar, but downhill after transferring to the table. Ignored for 45+ minutes, had to rely on another waiter to take our order. BBQ shrimp was the highlight, but the wood plank grilled fish was overpriced and small. Rabbit dish was enjoyable. Hit and miss service ruined the overall experience.",
    "This place is absolutely adorable with a cute and casual interior. It's clean and has a variety of delicious Vietnamese and other types of food. The banh mi and boba tea were both tasty, and the staff was friendly. The drink card for a free tenth drink and convenient hours make it even better.",
    "Stopped at Walgreens hoping to find the new ELF Villain's collection, but this location never gets them, according to the cosmetics person. Disappointing, but I'll have to search elsewhere.",
    "Best Italian food ever! Small, elegant restaurant with amazing entrees and tasty cheesecake. The staff was incredibly friendly. Highly recommend for a date night.",
    "This is my go-to spot for fish tacos! The beef taco and chicken fajitas were average, but the fish tacos are amazing. The prices are affordable and two tacos fill me up. The interior and patio are awesome, and there's a Ben and Jerry's next door for dessert. Overall, a happy visit every time!",
    "Excellent service! Replaced my dive watch battery in a jiffy at a fair price. Staff was friendly, prompt, and there were enough members to assist. Location is conveniently located.",
    "Stopped here last week and was pleasantly surprised by the great location and peaceful atmosphere under the shade of big old trees. Despite the limited seating, the food was served quickly. My buffalo burger was outstanding and one of the best I've ever had. However, the tri-tip sandwich was disappointing, being dry and consisting only of meat on big bread. The horseradish sauce was the saving grace. Overall, I give the tri-tip a 3 and my hubby gives it a 4, while the buffalo burger deserves a definite 5++. Worth a visit for a unique atmosphere and peaceful experience not far from town.",
    "I have frequented the Mad Mex, University City location for years and was pleased to see the new location closer to my home. Happy Hour offers great deals on Margaritas and wings, while the food is average. However, the staff could improve in chaos and crowd management for a better dining experience.",
    "I had a great experience taking my boyfriend for a tour and beer sampling at Yuengling on a Saturday. We were pleasantly surprised by how close it was to us. Before going, make sure to check the website for tour times and read the FAQ's. We noticed some people wearing flip flops on the tour, even though closed toe shoes are insisted upon. It's worth noting that there is no production on Saturdays, so the brewery was quiet and empty. The tour itself was about 40 minutes long and started with a video about the history of Yuengling. Our guide was knowledgeable and took us through various parts of the brewery. The highlight was the tasting room, where we got to try different beers for free (tips encouraged). Unfortunately, they were out of a few beers that day. Overall, it was a great tour and I plan on revisiting with my parents.",
    "Overall, I was really disappointed with my experience at this location of Marathon. The energetic server had a frantic energy and rushed us out of our booth, even bringing boxes for our food without asking. When we wanted to have another round of drinks with a friend, he told us we couldn't stay in the booth and had to move to the bar. It made us feel uncomfortable and we ended up leaving. Additionally, the food was not that great. Overall, not pleased with the service or the food.",
    "We arrived for lunch at 12pm on a Friday, and despite it being not busy, service was incredibly slow. Despite being pleasant and kind, we had to complain numerous times just to get our beverages. Additionally, it took them 40 minutes to inform us that a beer we ordered was no longer available. While the food was good, the prolonged wait and slow service made it not worth it.",
    "I stumbled upon this organic beer and burger spot and was pleasantly surprised. The menu offers both pre-made and customizable burgers, complemented by a selection of rotating beers and specials. The friendly staff and inviting atmosphere added to the overall experience. Just a heads up, burgers are served a la carte, so make sure to order sides if you'd like fries. Vegetarian options like sandwiches and salads are also available, making it a vegetarian-friendly spot.",
    "I had mixed experiences at Earl's new American kitchen. While the food was good but not great, the service was lacking, especially with a rude bartender. Consequently, I would not personally return or recommend this place to others.",
    "Jake's is a decent franchise with delicious burgers, but lacks in ambiance and fries. Stick to the original location for a better overall experience.",
    "I had a disappointing experience at this shop on Broad Street. Despite needing a jump for my car right in front of their store, I was told they couldn't assist me because they couldn't leave the store. Even when I suggested that another employee could help or they could assist me later, I was met with a firm refusal. It's ironic and frustrating that a place servicing cars couldn't even offer a simple jump. The service was lacking and definitely not customer-oriented. The employee behind the counter seemed more interested in surfing the web and playing on their phone. Overall, it was a disappointing and frustrating experience.",
    "The Pulled Pork Nachos were a delightful twist on the traditional dish, as they were served with crispy potato chips instead of the usual tortilla chips. They paired perfectly with a refreshing Beer or Bloody Mary. Delicious!",
    "I really enjoyed my stay at this cute and conveniently located place in Santa Barbara. The room was clean and overlooked a lovely courtyard and spa. The amenities like the fireplace, refrigerator, and ample storage space were great. Wine and cheese at 5 was a nice touch. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only downside was a little stuffiness in the room, but it was easily remedied with open windows and a ceiling fan. Overall, a pleasant stay at a good price. Would consider staying here again.",
    "Mirna's is a hidden gem with huge portions and affordable prices. The pasta dishes are a must-try and their specialty. Although they also serve decent fish, the pasta plates steal the show. The free hummus and pita they occasionally treat customers to is a nice touch. Just make sure to call ahead for a reservation due to limited seating. BYOB!",
    "I generally prefer independent restaurants, but the overpriced center city Philadelphia hype didn't impress me. The restaurant was spacious compared to other places in south Philly where we usually celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday. However, the prices were surprisingly high compared to what was listed on the online menu. The food and portions were average, but the dessert stood out as unique. The coordination between the bus help and waiter was off, with the bus help asking if we were done with our plates just as the waiter was discussing desserts. As expected in Philly, the bathroom was small considering the size of the restaurant.",
    "Platoon is amazing! Steve C is an exceptional trainer who customizes workouts based on your abilities and preferences. I started going once a week but quickly increased my attendance to 3-5 days a week. The staff is friendly and accommodating, and billing and scheduling are always hassle-free. Highly recommend!",
    "The Tater-Tots were tasty, although nothing extraordinary. The Burger was decent. Convenient lunch option with helpful staff offering local directions.",
    "I used to rate this place higher but based on a recent experience, I have decided to downgrade. Visited with my in-laws, one of whom is a senior, and tried to use a $5 off coupon along with the senior discount. The cashier refused to apply the coupon, claiming it was against management's rules. Disappointed in the lack of logic and poor customer experience. Management should take responsibility for this, not the cashier.",
    "Great first visit! Ordered 4 delicious Chicago dogs through the drive-thru. Only thing missing was the poppyseed bun and celery salt. SuperGyro is the only place within 28 miles where you can get a Chicago dog. Loved the 100% beef hot dogs with neon green relish, sport peppers, onions, dill pickle tomatoes & onion. Will definitely be back to try more items on the menu.",
    "Wawa is a beacon in a cold world. The sandwiches are great and they offer the expected convenience store snacks and drinks. Though this location isn't as friendly, it still satisfies my snacking needs.",
    "Stopped by this bar on the way back to the hotel for a second drink after a disappointing experience elsewhere. Opted for the hand grenades without studying the menu and boy, were they worth it! At $9 each, they packed a punch and we were definitely feeling it by the end. Great atmosphere with a band playing and open air. Enjoyed singing along and had a lot of fun. Close to Jackson Square, highly recommend.",
    "I highly recommend this location for all your shipping needs. Despite being on a busy corner, it's easy to access. Although my first visit was mediocre with an unfriendly staff member, my second visit redeemed the experience. The woman who assisted me was helpful, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond. The store is clean and efficiently packed with a variety of products. While the staff may not engage in small talk, they provide exceptional service. In summary, this location deserves 5 stars and I will continue to utilize their services.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken BBQ burritos at this place. The variety of ingredients made it even more enjoyable. It is a great spot for a family meal, although it would be even better if they had a play area for kids.",
    "Stopped here for some chai and coffee. Quick service, not many people. Chai was great, forgot to buy more coffee, but no worries, we have Starbucks at home.",
    "Overall, my experience with this young start-up company has been positive. Despite some impatience in the gun community, the owner has shown integrity and has stood by his word in my interactions with him. I met Jacob, the owner, at a gun show in Las Vegas and purchased a well-crafted Cerakoted billet lower. The machining and Cerakote job are of high quality. Furthermore, the owner has been prompt and responsive in addressing my inquiries via email.",
    "I was very impressed with this place! The menu and food were amazing, with creative options like fruit bruschetta which was yum! The Popeye skillet and Roadhouse sw were also great. However, it was freezing inside and lacked ambiance. Some background music and better lighting would easily fix that. Customer service was good, but a bit disconnected. Nevertheless, I would definitely go back.",
    "Amazing fill and gel pedicure! Despite being close to closing time, the staff took their time and fulfilled all my requests. The salon was clean and the staff was exceptionally friendly. Surpassed my expectations for a mall nail salon. The foot and hand massages were heavenly. I'll definitely be returning!",
    "I had a memorable experience at this restaurant. The cashier was incredibly nice and helpful. I ordered the Devils Delight, which turned out to be a delicious burger named after the cashier. The burger was cooked perfectly and had a great combination of flavors. It was accompanied by the amazing truffle fries. The quality of food and service was excellent, although it was a bit pricey. I will definitely be coming back.",
    "I stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for a healthy dinner option, but was initially deterred by the distance. However, I couldn't stop thinking about their Be My Bison burger and ultimately decided to give it a try. I was thrilled when my order was ready as soon as I arrived. I must say, I am absolutely in love with this place! It's a dream come true for someone like me who struggles to find healthy dining options. Thank you!",
    "This place was awful. The service was terrible, with no acknowledgment or attention from the staff. The menu was limited and overpriced, with poorly seasoned and overly breaded food. The only positive was the good music and the food being decent, but overall, I would never recommend this place. However, their takeout could be repurposed as great dog food.",
    "The service was good and the mesquite wings were excellent, perfect for sharing or saving some for later. However, the weak lemonade was the weakest I've ever had.",
    "I lucked out with this taqueria in our neighborhood. Taqueria Guerrero is the best Mexican food in New Orleans. From the delicious 3-taco plate to the flavorful burrito, everything is incredibly tasty. I suggest this place every time I want to go out or get takeout.",
    "The food was good, but the service and cleanliness were lacking. Sticky table and mix-up with orders. Great pork belly tacos and spicy beef pho, but wait for the check was long. Go for the food, not the service.",
    "The second visit to this key shop was a charm. The first time their hours didn't suit me, but the second time proved to be very helpful. The gentleman behind the counter was pleasant and quickly cut several keys that big box stores couldn't duplicate. Overall, the experience was quick, polite, efficient, and cost-effective.",
    "Terrible work quality, rude attitude, and disrespectful behavior. Subpar service for nails and fingers. Attempting to provide feedback only leads to confrontations and gossip in another language.",
    "I am extremely disappointed with my experience at this salon. Despite receiving a message from the owner offering a free service to fix a previous mistake, my hair turned out poorly once again. I clearly communicated what I wanted and emphasized that I did not want any orange tones, but my hair still ended up damaged, brittle, and brassy. The service was rushed, and I felt like the owner did not care about my satisfaction. Additionally, other clients in the salon were also unhappy with their results. It is clear that this salon does not prioritize customer happiness and is more concerned with profit than quality. I will not be returning and caution others to avoid this salon.",
    "We had our destination wedding at the Riviera Mansion and it was an incredible experience. The venue is beautiful and the pricing was reasonable. The staff, especially Breanna and Eli, were amazing to work with and attended to every detail. The layout of the mansion was perfect for our multigenerational wedding, providing something for everyone. The bartending service was exceptional, with a signature drink that was a hit among guests. Overall, a five-star experience and we highly recommend it.",
    "Dave was an incredibly friendly and helpful food cart owner. He took the time to explain the menu, and the hot dogs were prepared quickly and tasted absolutely amazing. The pizza dog and custom creation were both outstanding, and to top it off, Dave generously added grilled jalape\u00f1os. Santa Barbara definitely needs more late-night food carts like this one!",
    "Had a less-than-pleasant experience at Wolfgang: overcrowded, dirty floors, and poor service. However, the redeeming factor was their exceptional crisp Chardonnay.",
    "This Wawa store is a winner! Not only did they lower gas prices significantly upon opening, but they also offer a convenient automatic start/stop digital air pump. The staff is friendly and efficient, and the store layout is well-designed. A great experience overall!",
    "Terrible experience. Mediocre food, extremely slow service, rude servers, and lots of billing mistakes. Would not recommend.",
    "The seafood restaurant on the edge of the pier offers a mixed dining experience. The clam chowder is excellent and worth ordering again, but the cioppino lacks flavor and variety of seafood. The crab salad sandwich is disappointing, with overpowering mayo and a lack of crab flavor. The overall atmosphere is better when seated outside, overlooking the ocean. Service is good, but expect a wait to be seated. While it's worth a visit, it's important to be selective with your order as the menu can be hit or miss.",
    "We had a great time at this place with our family. The staff were friendly and helpful, making it a fun and enjoyable activity.",
    "Chef Sbraga's lavender honey fried chicken at Juniper Commons is some of the best I've had in a long time. The crunchy coating and juicy inside pair perfectly with the sweet honey glaze. The biscuit is also delicious. Every dish at Juniper Commons is top-notch. Chef Sbraga knows fried chicken.",
    "Overall, my experience at Casselli's was disappointing. The waiter's unpleasant attitude, coupled with the overdone food and disruptive opera singer, made it difficult to enjoy my visit. Although convenient parking is a plus, the opportunity cost of returning to Casselli's is too high compared to other good Italian restaurants. Furthermore, the fact that it is cash-only adds an inconvenience. I will likely not be returning.",
    "Although the initial experience with our friendly salesman was positive, the negotiations process turned sour. We were handed off to the manager, who seemed unaccustomed to dealing with informed shoppers and resorted to dishonesty. If it wasn't for the immediate need and specific color requirement, we would have gone elsewhere. If you choose to visit this dealership, come prepared with pricing information from other dealers, but consider buying from a different dealer if given the chance.",
    "I had a great time at this casino, conveniently located just an hour away from Orlando. Despite the typical casino atmosphere, the overpriced burgers and fries at the Hard Rock Cafe were a downside. However, I had a stroke of luck playing the Breakfast at Tiffany's slot machine, which was enjoyable as a fan of the movie.",
    "Merrigans is the go-to place in Tucson for honest and affordable RV repairs. While their phone communication may not be the best, their expertise and collection of parts for older RVs make up for it. Patience is rewarded with quality repairs at fair prices. Additionally, they offer a free 24-hour dump station and water. Choose Merrigans for a job done right without breaking the bank.",
    "Lisa is absolutely amazing at what she does! Catch her on TV, she's a must-watch!",
    "This place is fantastic! The brunch is delicious, the staff is incredibly friendly, and the cocktails are top-notch. The cute and comfy design adds to the overall delightful experience. As a lesbian, having a bar like this in the neighborhood makes me incredibly happy. I can't wait to bring my mom here for Mother's Day.",
    "I regret to say that I will not be returning to this location. Despite contacting the manager about a poorly made pizza, their response was unresponsive and they failed to address the issue. Even after providing photo evidence, there was no further communication from their end.",
    "I highly recommend this amazing restaurant with great food and a fantastic overall experience. It's best to go with a group of about 6 people to keep costs reasonable, but if money is not an issue, go ahead and splurge! The staff is helpful and knowledgeable about their wine selection, and they even let you take home any unfinished bottles. The cheese platter has a good variety, although I wish they had more cured meats. Finding a seat can be challenging, but worth the wait. The outdoor seating is lovely, especially with live music. Make sure to order the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and the goat cheese and mushroom dish - both are outstanding. Everything I've tried here has been great. Just relax, enjoy the food, and have a wonderful time!",
    "Went to see my son's band Last Frontier and was incredibly impressed with the staff, food, and overall experience. The pork belly and fish nachos were amazing, and they had a fantastic selection of whisky. The sound system for the band was top notch.",
    "This paint store is outstanding. I've been here multiple times without any issues. It's the best paint store I've ever been to, apart from big names like Home Depot or Lowes. They offer a wide range of paints and all the necessary supplies. The staff is friendly, helpful, and they even keep your paint information on file. Look out for their sales, especially the 30% off deals. I highly recommend their interior Super Paint.",
    "Excellent experience! Delicious food, impeccable service. Enjoyed dining on the deck, witnessing a stunning dolphin display. Definitely a must-visit again!",
    "Whole Foods is an attractive store with beautiful displays and a sense of smugness. It's ironic that they are trying to position themselves as a 'value' food store when others have been doing it for years. For affordable options, look elsewhere. However, for lunch or a quick stop, it's a great choice. The store is enormous, clean, and well-stocked. It's a welcome addition to Reno, which needs retail to support its outdoor-focused community. The proximity to the freeway makes it convenient for travelers. The produce, cheese, and bakery options are fantastic, although they can be pricey.",
    "This place never disappoints! Fantastic service and delicious food. We're regulars for a reason - consistently amazing!",
    "The Chopped Italian salad from Fresh was disappointing and lacking in flavor. It could benefit from more Italian ingredients such as olives, artichoke hearts, and pepperoncinis. The salami also lacked flavor. Considering the positive reviews, I may give them another chance and try their panini instead, although I generally prefer salads for summer lunches.",
    "Tyson delivered exceptional service with a prompt and efficient turnaround. I approached him with an RV featuring a ford front end, and he promptly scheduled the repairs and completed them ahead of schedule. The necessary parts were ordered and ready the next day, allowing the team to quickly work on my vehicle. In just 3 days, my RV bumper was replaced, allowing me to hit the road again. I highly recommend Tyson's services and will only trust him with my vehicles in the future. Manny and Tyson are outstanding!",
    "Had a great lunch at Johnny Rockets in the casino. Lyndel, our server, was amazing and attentive. Delicious food, left feeling stuffed.",
    "This place is absolutely fantastic! Exceptional food and impeccable service. The staff is incredibly nice and generous, creating a cool atmosphere. I'm a regular customer, dining here almost every weekend. And trust me, their Cuban espresso is unbeatable!",
    "Great pizza with a variety of fantastic options such as the California, Meatlovers, and Veggie pizzas. Owner Pete is friendly and always present. Unfortunately, the shop is temporarily closed due to fire damage from the neighboring laundry mat. Can't wait for them to reopen, as I miss their amazing lunch special and delicious pizzas. Definitely the best local pizza in Hatboro.",
    "The Buffalo chicken cheese dip is absolutely amazing! The wait staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable.",
    "Incredibly impressed with the pizza joint! Despite a minor system hiccup, the guy went above and beyond, making and delivering a fresh, hot pizza along with 2 complimentary brownies within 20 minutes. Fantastic customer service and delicious food. My new favorite delivery spot!",
    "Great 21st birthday dinner with family! Food and drinks were superb but overpriced. Lobster mac and cheese was a standout. Complimentary desserts were a nice touch. Overall, enjoyable experience but pricey.",
    "This place has great ambience for both a fun date and a beer and sports crowd. The open kitchen adds to the experience. They offer a great beer selection. The rosemary fries are a must-try and the house burger is also very good. Will definitely be returning.",
    "Overall rating: 3 stars\n\nThe food was excellent, with generous portions and flavorful options. However, the beer was disappointing, lacking in taste and not living up to the expected hoppy flavors. It's a good choice for lunch downtown, but not recommended solely for the brews.",
    "I highly recommend this new boutique taqueria near Rivers Edge Apartments. The head chef, nominated for a James Beard Award, has created a flavorful and diverse menu. With both indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a bar nearby, it offers a great dining experience. I've tried every taco and appetizer, all made with fresh local ingredients, and they are fantastic. The mushroom and short rib tacos are especially delicious, but I suggest trying them all. Whether for lunch or dinner, this place is a must-visit. I'll definitely be returning!",
    "Capofitto is a hidden gem with no lines and cheaper, tastier desserts than Franklin Fountain. The gelato is to die for, especially the chocolat scurio and pera combo. Can't wait to go back and try their pizza too!",
    "A.I. DuPont is the best family hospital on the East Coast. They excel in coordinating multiple MD visits in a single day and provide exceptional care. The renovated wing offers great caregiver accommodations and the staff is friendly and attentive. Highly recommend traveling from NY for child's care.",
    "Highly recommend Vetri in Philly for an exquisite Chef Tasting experience with 9 delicious courses and amazing wine.",
    "This place is a true American diner gem. With its long-standing history, it's not hard to see why it has stood the test of time. The waitresses are always courteous and the food is made from scratch, which is a rare find these days. Their fried chicken is hands down the best I've ever tasted, and it's always fresh. If you're a coffee lover, you'll be delighted to know they offer bottomless refills at a very reasonable price. And don't forget to try their delicious pie.",
    "Terrible experience. Groupon issues and negligence led to driving with an old oil filter for 5k miles. Awful customer service and rude attitude. Find a better place.",
    "I attended the #welldoneTBO tweet-up at Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza and had a great experience. Amazing customer service, delicious menu items, and a personal favorite was the Philly Cheesesteak Pizza. The Cauliflower pizza was also a delightful vegetarian option. The carmelized onion-smothered wings were out of this world. Tasted other dishes like meatballs, ribs, and salad, all very good. Ordered a half and half pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms which was so good. If they offered liquor, I would have given them five stars. Thanks, Anthony's, for a fantastic evening. We'll definitely be back.",
    "Exceptional service and delectable cuisine accompanied by a mesmerizing dry ice fog, elevating the dining experience to new heights.",
    "Delicious, authentic New Orleans cuisine. Busy but got seated quickly. Opted for the a la carte and it exceeded our expectations. The highlight of our trip!",
    "This restaurant is ideal for hosting out-of-town guests, especially for breakfast or brunch. It gets quite busy on weekends, with wait times exceeding an hour after 9:30 AM, and service can be a bit slow. However, the extensive menu and delectable food make up for the wait. Additionally, they have a fantastic bakery, coffee, and gelato counter, providing instant service or treats to enjoy while waiting.",
    "The food is excellent, but the service was disappointing and made me feel rushed and unimportant. Shocked that the waitress withheld my change, leaving me feeling cheated. Will consider returning in the future with exact change and adjusted tip due to the experience.",
    "The sushi at this place is solid, with Mesa rolls being my personal favorite. However, the pick-up service needs improvement as they often give inaccurate estimations, causing delays. I would rate them 4 stars if this issue was resolved.",
    "The best burger in Philly. Fresh bread, juicy meat, friendly service, and affordable price.",
    "This place is a great spot for wine, cheese, and outdoor music. However, the food was unremarkable, particularly the bacon-wrapped dates, brussel sprouts, and sardines that were sent back due to their unpleasant smell and taste.",
    "The Po-Boys were excellent in taste but lacked sufficient catfish, quite skimpy. Yet, the service was very good.",
    "I had the worst Mediterranean food experience. The hummus was drowned in an excessive amount of olive oil, and the pita bread was burnt to the point of being black. The food made me sick because of the overwhelming oil content. The manager's behavior was terrible too, offering a \"favor\" with a condescending tone and yelling from across the restaurant instead of talking to us. We didn't feel comfortable giving feedback due to his negative attitude. The sign claiming the \"cleanest bathroom in town\" was the only positive takeaway.",
    "The bagels are great but it's disappointing they close early. Staff could be friendlier, but the tasty bagels make up for it!",
    "The hotel was fantastic, with a great location and friendly staff. The room was spacious and impeccably clean, with a well-stocked kitchenette. The natural light from the windows surrounding the bed was a plus. Opting out of housekeeping also gave a $5 credit at the restaurant. The pool was small, but the hot tub was always available. The bar had a decent drink selection, although they were out of mint for a mojito. The burger was okay, and the dessert was mediocre but free with the credit. The breakfast spread was nice, although the coffee was weak and often had grounds in it.",
    "The falafel wrap was average, but slightly overpriced. The ambiance of the sitting area was unappealing, resembling a cold and unwelcoming cave. Manayunk offers better dining options.",
    "I had a great experience at this place when I needed assistance due to a flat tire and car damage while driving cross country. Brian was very friendly, quickly assessed the situation, and fixed everything within 30 minutes. Highly recommend!",
    "Visited this eatery with a party of 8 on Friday, July 22. Great location for exploring the Quarter afterwards. Unfortunately, only 2 out of the 8 dishes ordered were tasty - the jambalaya and file gumbo. The rest, including red beans and rice, meatloaf, Mac and cheese, shrimp po boy, and chicken wings, were bland and a waste of money. The staff was nice, but overall the food was mediocre.",
    "Santa Barbara's seafood market offers an unbeatable freshness, rivaling the renowned Tokyo fish market. Despite lacking ambiance, the ocean view from the outdoor seating compensates for it. Delight in a wide selection of delectable shellfish, tailored to satisfy your cravings. Although you might face a wait during busy times, the experience is undoubtedly worthwhile. Use the wait to explore the nearby pier and make space for the mouthwatering feast that awaits you.",
    "This place offers creative and tasty food, decent house wines, and well-made but small cocktails. Service has always been good, although I haven't been during peak times. The patio is a great spot for hanging out with friends.",
    "Skyway Cafe (formerly Skyway Jacks) offers huge plates of delicious food at affordable prices. The bovine decor provides a cozy atmosphere, reminiscent of a local diner. The service is prompt and the coffee keeps flowing. Don't miss their morning breakfast deal for a satisfying start to your day. And most importantly, the banana pecan pancakes are a must-try. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",
    "Terrible experience! Waited over an hour for a shot, only to be told they were closing the line. Complete disappointment. Avoid this place.",
    "Extremely disappointed with the customer service. Don't count on finding any assistance, good luck.",
    "Fair Grinds in New Orleans is a quaint and hipster coffee shop with a beautiful outdoor seating area. The small cold brew with vanilla and gluten-free zucchini bread were delicious. The option of adding whole milk was a rare and enjoyable treat. However, the limited gluten-free offerings were disappointing. Overall, a great place to visit if in the neighborhood.",
    "I absolutely loved this place! The sweet selection is incredible, especially the gooey butter cookies and the German chocolate cupcake. Highly recommend!",
    "Decent frozen yogurt with ample topping choices and a variety of flavors. However, costs can escalate when weighing your cup. Limited seating inside and the staff lacks energy. Bubble tea was unimpressive.",
    "Amazing food and worth the drive! Authentic Taiwanese cuisine. Loved the Chicken Basil and their Boba Tea is great too! Don't listen to the negative reviews, try it and judge for yourself!",
    "CRU is a charming wine bar with a modern atmosphere. The wine flight and food options were delicious, with the Farmers Plate being a standout. I loved the cozy and quaint feel of the place and can't wait to return.",
    "I've been a loyal customer for years, and this spot remains truly great. In my opinion, it offers one of the top 3 steaks in the city. Even after a name change, the quality has stayed consistent. For a delicious twist, I highly recommend trying their chicken cheesesteak.",
    "Pina's in Roxborough is a highly underrated place to eat. Their stromboli and sicilian pie are both top-notch, but the sandwiches and pizza are just average. The chicken park dish is a standout, with a generous portion size and mouthwatering flavors. Overall, Pina's is a satisfying and filling dining option.",
    "Overall, this cafe offers tasty food and a wide variety of options at their grocery section. Although slightly expensive, the quality justifies the price. I particularly enjoyed their vegan sandwich and tofu melt, accompanied by an extensive assortment of vegan desserts.",
    "This place is amazing! They serve the best burgers in New Orleans with excellent service. The food is fresh, and they make sure you are served promptly. We tried the Gator and deer burgers, which were delicious. Personally, I loved their buffalo wings. Their drinks are also great. We left extremely satisfied and will definitely return before leaving town.",
    "Highly recommend this restaurant! Great old school atmosphere with 3 floors. The food is amazing, especially the veal, clams casino, mussles, pasta, and homemade garlic bread. The staff is friendly and helpful. Recently tried the gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce and it became my new favorite dish. A must-visit place for food lovers!",
    "Home Wine Kitchen's \"No Menu Monday\" is a must-try for food enthusiasts in St. Louis. The three-course meal, priced at $30, offers delicious and customized dishes. The starters, lamb meatballs and goat cheese-stuffed peppers, were excellent. The mains, corvina fish and swordfish steak, were tasty, although the corvina was slightly too complex for my taste. Dessert, champagne gelatin and chocolate tart, was delightful. The staff was friendly and professional, and the ambiance was pleasant. Overall, a great dining experience, but I am curious to try their regular menu next time.",
    "I went to this swanky restaurant for a special reunion dinner with friends. The food was worth the price, but my party thought it was expensive. I had the lobster bake which was delicious, although not fantastic. The Neopolitan Old Fashion was made perfectly. My friends ordered various dishes and drinks, and the bill was $170, which some of them found unexpected. The waiter was fantastic, very attentive and even surprised us with a birthday dessert. Service gets 5 stars, food gets 3 stars, ambience gets 4 stars, and price gets 2 stars. Overall, I was satisfied.",
    "I have been going to Susanna Foo since I was 6 months old and have fond memories of the restaurant. The food is reliable but lacks excitement for me as an adult. The service, decor, and ambience are always impeccable. I hope Susanna adds new flavors or embraces her Chinese roots for a more ethnic menu. I am hopeful for a revitalization and to rekindle my love for Susanna Foo.",
    "Spiro's is a hidden gem in California with delicious Greek food. Despite its small advertisement, the restaurant offers a delightful dining experience. The Greek lemon soup was excellent and the Moussaka was satisfying. The waiter's suggestion of Sea Bass was also tempting. Overall, the dinner was terrific and the exceptional service from Neil makes Spiro's a must-visit restaurant in the area.",
    "As a BBQ judge, I have to say this is not barbecue in any region, be it Texas, the southeast, or KC. The brisket is more like fatty pot roast, lacking smoke flavor and with a mushy texture. My sandwich was majorly fat-filled, with meatless chunks of fat. It seems either the owner doesn't care or the staff lacks knowledge. Unfortunately, you can find much better BBQ elsewhere.",
    "This place is an ideal spot to catch a sunset. A bit of a drive from Tampa but definitely worth it. The energetic music and lively ambiance make it enjoyable. The rocky beach means no swimming, but it doesn't matter because the view and atmosphere are incredible. Been coming here with our boys since they were babies, and it never disappoints. The food and drinks don't leave a strong impression, but that's not what we come for.",
    "This place has been thriving since 1958 for a reason. They offer great soft serve and scooped ice cream cones, as well as delightful boats, floats, and sundaes. The prices are also affordable. Highly recommend!",
    "I stumbled upon this Mexican restaurant while in the area and craving some authentic cuisine. The pazole was delicious and had a great combination of flavors. The lettuce was a bit disappointing, but hot sauce made it better. The taco lunch special was good too. The service was amazing and the salsa was fresh, although a bit too sweet for my liking. Don't miss out on the pineapple water, even if you don't usually like pineapples. I can't wait to come back and try their burritos. A hidden gem worth indulging in!",
    "The restaurant has a great ambiance with attractive employees and perfect lighting. It's suitable for a blind date and the service is good and timely. However, the high prices for what you get and the kitchen's lack of accommodation bring down the rating. The serving sizes can be small for the price, and the kitchen refused to make a simple substitution. Overall, it's disappointing and leaves a negative impression.",
    "Interesting destination with great decor, noisy atmosphere, and funky vibe. Hip servers, but rushed and inattentive service. Not safe or knowledgeable for gluten-free individuals, awful GF buns. Parking is a challenge for those with cars.",
    "The drinks and food were excellent, especially the pulled pork and fried chicken po boy. The mac and cheese was outstanding. The prices were reasonable, and they had a great selection of draft beers. Additionally, it's a bonus that they serve food until 1am.",
    "This restaurant offers a disappointing dining experience with slow service, a dirty environment, and mediocre, overpriced breakfast options. I strongly recommend trying other nearby options like First Watch or Pinky's instead, as they offer better quality and value. The claims of higher prices at these alternatives are unfounded. Avoid wasting your time at this deteriorated establishment.",
    "El Arado is a decent place with reasonable prices, attentive staff, and good food. Despite a slight issue with the table, the waiter was quiet but attentive. The drinks were reasonably priced and the food was fresh, hot, and met everyone's specific requests. Overall, a good option for affordable and filling meals before a night out in Fountain Square, or even for those heading to strip clubs.",
    "I highly recommend the Loew's hotel - it's exceptionally clean, stylish, and offers amazing service. The breakfast is fantastic, with futuristic aesthetics that impress even the kids. The rooms are spacious, and the parking is convenient. 5 stars!",
    "I finally tried honeygrow and it's amazing! I had their Sour Cherry BBQ stir fry with chicken and it was low calorie and filling. Ordering and paying at the kiosk was convenient, and the employees were friendly and efficient. I'll definitely be returning!",
    "The cheeseburger was superb with a perfectly cooked patty, great sauce, and a soft bun. The complimentary zucchini bread was delicious. The service was good, and they had a great selection of G+Ts. The ambience was cool, and it's conveniently located downstairs from my apartment. The only potential downside is the price, and the waitresses' attitude towards our simple order needs further assessment. However, overall, I'm excited to return.",
    "Overall, Smokey offers a variety of dining options, beverages for a fee, a pricey hotel, free parking, various entertainment, an ATM for those concerned about self-control, and gambling for those willing to take the risk. As a non-smoker with allergies, the experience was slightly hindered. However, even as an observer, there is still enjoyment to be had.",
    "Disappointing 4.5-star rating. So-so burgers, chain restaurant vibe. Maybe better on weekends? Won't return.",
    "This is my absolute favorite brewery in the world! Every time we visit St. Louis, we make sure to stop by. We recently did the \"Beer School\" with friends and it was awesome. I highly recommend it, especially if it's your first visit. Start with the brewery tour to see the Clydesdales and learn about the brewing process\u2014it's amazing! I can't wait to go back and try the \"Brew Master\" next time. Until then, cheers to Budweiser!",
    "I arrived early for a reservation, but the hostesses ignored us and gave priority to a walk-in party. They blamed their mistake on a new employee and showed no remorse. Terrible customer service and lack of professionalism. Will not be going back.",
    "The food was excellent, but unfortunately, they refused to honor their Yelp offer of 10% off for checking in and reviewing their business until our next visit. Despite having 4 hours left to redeem the deal, they displayed bad business practice. Great food, but left disappointed by their actions.",
    "I have only visited this location a few times, mostly for sending packages, and I appreciate the presence of an automated machine which is lacking at my closest post office. However, the outstanding customer service we encountered during our visit to submit passport applications deserves special mention. The representative we dealt with was exceptional - efficient, friendly, and well-informed. We were in and out in no time, and she even provided me with follow-up forms and guidance regarding my name change. I hope to have more experiences like this in the future, and she should be recognized as a model for training others.",
    "Highly recommended starting point for a health journey with vast selection of vitamins, dietary supplements, beauty products, and homeopathic items. Super helpful staff assists in finding essential items and provides suggestions. Love the rewards program and acceptance of digital coupons.",
    "I absolutely love this shoppe! The staff is awesome, creating a great atmosphere. They offer a variety of healthy and tasty treats, including delicious croissants. The menu for breakfast and lunch is impressive, and every dish I've tried here has been nothing short of fantabulous.",
    "I had a delightful Saturday morning at this place, enjoying a scrumptious Cranberry Orange Muffin and a Caffe Latte. The ambience was lovely, and the service was quick and efficient.",
    "The best sushi spot with the friendliest staff! A top menu choice, making every meal exceptional!",
    "This coffee shop is a must-visit in the city! Amazing food, fresh and delicious. Cool edgy vibe with plenty of comfy seating, both indoors and outdoors. Highly recommended, especially if you're craving good food along with your coffee.",
    "I highly recommend this place for the best burritos in town! Great salsas, relaxed atmosphere, excellent service and price. The chicken and chorizo combo is my personal favorite, but the smoked brisket is also delicious. The medium burrito is more than enough, unless you're training for an eating event. Family-owned and full of flavor. Top recommendation for good, healthy food at a reasonable price.",
    "This lunch menu is a real treat! The sandwiches are absolutely delicious, satisfying every taste bud. Although a bit pricey and on the smaller side, the quality makes it well worth it. Can't wait to try their steaks! Food and service both get a perfect 5/5, and the price gets a 4/5 for being a little high but great quality.",
    "The selection is tasty and the atmosphere is preppy. The What's Up Doc omelet is a safe choice, although the size may vary. The french toasts are perfect for those with a sweet tooth. The Fancy Breakfast Sandwich with substituted bacon is a winner. Don't forget to try their great mimosas!",
    "If you're a fan of 50's-Midcentury modern style, this store is a must-visit! While the prices may be a bit higher compared to my favorite STL stores, it's undeniably a one-of-a-kind gem.",
    "Terrible experience. Constant construction, dirty room, and unprofessional service. Will not be returning.",
    "The fried rice is amazing and the Pho is the best I've had in Nashville. As a Seattleite, I'm picky about Vietnamese food, but this place exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend for first-timers and Vietnamese food enthusiasts!",
    "I walked from our condo and discovered this amazing place! Delicious sliders, donuts, and unique drinks. The atmosphere is awesome and the staff is extremely friendly. I will definitely be returning!",
    "Casa Video is hands down the best video rental store out there. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, but it's their exceptional selection that truly sets them apart. Whether you're after the latest releases or vintage VHS tapes, they've got you covered, all at an affordable price. I only wish there was a place like Casa Video in Chicago.",
    "I had a satisfying and reasonably priced lunch at this sushi place. I ordered a long roll, a hand roll, a drink, and a chocolate mochi, which I absolutely loved. The total cost was just under $20 with tip. The rolls were fresh and delicious, but the mochi stole the show with its creamy and tasty flavor.",
    "I had a quick and positive experience at this store. The staff was friendly, and the store was clean and well-stocked. However, I have concerns about its longevity, given the number of nearby closures.",
    "Best Pizza: The perfect place for pizza lovers. Exceptional staff, refreshing cold beer, and perfectly maintained taps. Don't miss out on their incredible 5-dollar beer and slice combo.",
    "Federal Donuts definitely lives up to its hype. As a vegetarian, I can vouch for their amazing donuts and coffee. The staff is exceptionally friendly, even during busy times. My husband is obsessed with their chicken, particularly the buttermilk ranch. It's an all-around wonderful experience.",
    "Despite the convenient location and great bar atmosphere, this place falls short in terms of food quality. We gave it three chances, but each dish we tried was subpar, except for the overly sweet Asian shrimp. On the first visit, we attributed the issues to a new restaurant finding its footing. However, the second visit only resulted in a dry turkey patty without informing us about the lack of buns. The manager did comp that meal, but the most recent experience with fish and chips served from a box and greasy chicken salad was the final straw. We won't be returning.",
    "Sapore offers a refreshing escape with its dark and cool interior. The reservation made seating hassle-free for our party of three. The customizable drinks were a pleasant surprise, especially the vodka martini with a blue-cheese-stuffed olive and anchovy. The Caprese salad was decent, while the Chicken Marsala was satisfying with enough leftovers. The dessert menu was excellent, with tiramisu being our choice. Would consider coming back for the martinis, appetizers, and desserts.",
    "Despite being located in a less trendy strip mall near Cool Springs, this version of Twelve South's hipster gourmet Burger Up still delivers in terms of taste. The burgers are delicious and messy, made with fresh meat and fixings. The regular fries are satisfying, but the truffle fries are outstanding, with a non-greasy finish topped with parmesan cheese. The chocolate milkshake, although simple, is perfectly made - creamy, not too sweet, and not overly chocolatey. For those looking for an upscale burger experience that still satisfies the burger-fries-shake holy trinity, this place is a must-visit.",
    "Terrible experience. Made an appointment to fix \"check engine\" light, but car wasn't even looked at until the next day. Had to wait an hour for them to give me my car due to poor parking management. No repair or maintenance needed. Won't be going back.",
    "RH&B was once known as the go-to spot in south Jersey for BBQ and blues, attracting customers with its great atmosphere. However, since the recent sale, the decision to eliminate live music has left a void. Although the food was only decent, it is the absence of live music that makes it hard to recommend this restaurant. The only aspect that I will truly miss are the wonderful people who worked there.",
    "This sandwich spot used to be reliable, but the last two experiences were disappointing. The cheesesteak lacked meat, and the roll was one of the worst and stale. Hopefully, it was just an off night. I'll give it another chance, but not anytime soon.",
    "I had a disappointing experience at this property. Despite being a SPG gold member, the staff did not accommodate my request for a larger room and I had to endure significant noise issues. The hotel's service was lacking, with long waiting times at the front desk. Overall, this hotel lacks luxury and needs improvement in its service.",
    "The food was fresh and delicious, though not extraordinary. The price was fair and the staff was very helpful and friendly.",
    "This hotel is decent, especially for business travelers. The rooms are comfortable with essential amenities. The cafe offers a decent deal, but it's unclear what is included. The hallways could use some maintenance, but it isn't a major issue. However, room cleaning can be inconsistent, as evidenced by a previous experience of finding food in the mini fridge.",
    "Henry's, the neighborhood coffee spot I recently discovered, unfortunately left a lackluster first impression. The atmosphere was standard with ordinary furniture, lacking uniqueness. The coffee, specifically the iced coffee, was bitter and disappointing. Hoping for a better experience with hot coffee or espresso in the future. Not off to a great start, Henry.",
    "We were thoroughly impressed with this hotel! The staff was welcoming, offering complementary cookies and water upon arrival. The Read it and Return program allowed us to borrow books during our stay. The room was clean and well equipped with amenities. The smoking area had comfortable seating. The complimentary breakfast was substantial and varied daily. The pool and hot tub were well-maintained. The late checkout time was a bonus. The staff was genuinely interested in our feedback. We highly recommend this hotel!",
    "Buying a car can be intimidating, but with thorough preparation and sticking to your position, you can achieve a fair deal. I visited multiple dealerships and chose Toyota of Santa Barbara because they had the vehicle I wanted. Sam Ladd, the salesman, treated me courteously and allowed me to test drive various cars. The negotiation process with Frank Flores, the sales manager, was business-like and he addressed my concerns. Overall, as long as the car performs well over time, I am satisfied with my purchase.",
    "Amazing bar with a fantastic atmosphere. Friendly staff, including the owner, create a welcoming vibe. The diverse crowd and staff make you feel right at home. Plus, the BBQ truck parked outside is top-notch!",
    "The staff was friendly, but the Italian food was average and served lukewarm. We visited during Christmas with a large group, attracted by the BYOB policy and absence of a fixed menu. The appetizers, including fried gnocchi and calamari, were decent. However, the main courses lacked creativity and variety, with unimpressive sauces. Even though the staff was accommodating, the lackluster food is not enticing enough for a return visit.",
    "This Chinese place is truly one of the best and friendliest spots to satisfy your taste buds. Don't miss out on trying their mouth-watering double treasure dish.",
    "I highly recommend Reno Vulcanizing for all your vehicle needs. The team, particularly Ken, Bruce, and the rest of the staff, have consistently provided honest, courteous, and helpful service. We have been loyal customers for years and would never consider taking our vehicles anywhere else.",
    "City Tour: 1 Star - Not worth it, no confirmation email, payment hassle, limited visibility, only two worthwhile stops. Take the green street cars or red bus tours instead.\n\nPlantation Tour: 5 Stars! Informative and balanced history, driver Stacie was great. Laura Plantation was amazing, Oak Alley was beautiful but focused on landowners. Buses are comfortable.\n\nSwamp Tour: 4 Stars - No alligators due to rain, but guide was knowledgeable. Avoid booking in cold or stormy weather. Comfortable buses.",
    "Based on this review, I would strongly advise avoiding this pizza place. The reviewer described it as the worst pizza they have ever had, with a thin crust that was not crunchy, poor quality olives, and a salad that was expensive and lacking in quality. The cheese on the salad looked powdered and came in a prepacked divider, which the reviewer considered a rip off. Although the knots were okay, the overall experience was negative. The reviewer typically prefers ordering from other pizza places like Grimaldi's, BJs, or Mellow Mushroom, or buying organic pizza from Publix or Whole Foods, which they find to be cheaper and tastier. They criticize Dominoes for being a reminder of the need for corporate chains to fall and prefer paying for quality rather than preservatives and poison. They are also planning to request a refund. This review serves as a clear warning to avoid this pizza place at all costs.",
    "Despite the nice ambiance and friendly staff, the absence of dark beer in February was a letdown. Summer beer in winter didn't quite hit the mark.",
    "Buddy Brew is fantastic, despite parking and occasional crowds. Friendly baristas, great food options, and carefully roasted coffee make it a must-try in Tampa. One of my absolute favorite places.",
    "Overrated. The crust sometimes burns and it's not to our taste, but the cauliflower salad and fried dough ball dessert were delicious.",
    "I recently used a gift certificate at this place after waiting for 6 months, and it was definitely worth the wait! It's the perfect lunch spot, and I fell in love with their mixed salad sandwich - absolutely delicious! The homemade ice cream is also incredibly tempting, and I can't wait to go back for more.",
    "I absolutely love this Italian restaurant! The food surpassed my expectations in terms of both quality and portion size. The staff, especially Alexa, treated us incredibly well every time we picked up or dined in. Thank you for an awesome experience!",
    "Highly recommend this spot in the Quarter for a refined drink and great service. The Manhattans with Carpano Antica Formula vermouth were the best I've ever had. The lamb meatballs were okay, but the spring rolls were excellent. Drinks were pricey but worth it for occasional nights out. Eric, the manager, was incredibly professional and friendly. We'll definitely return.",
    "I used to frequent this place for their lunch special which was a great deal. Though my husband isn't a fan, I still enjoy going occasionally. Prices have increased recently, but it's still consistently satisfying.",
    "Had the classic burger and fries, both delicious. Service was excellent and the Bananas Foster spiked milkshake was a must-try. Great experience overall.",
    "I visited this location for the first time and had a frustrating experience. Despite a few open tables, the service was slow and disorganized. We waited 15 minutes for our food order to be taken and witnessed another customer receiving their food before us, despite arriving later. Our waitress was inattentive and the kitchen seemed unbothered by the delay. After 40 minutes with no food, we decided to leave and received no apology. I won't be returning to this location. Waste of time.",
    "The bakery is AMAZING! The tres leche is just like grandma used to make, minus the liquor. The cannoli and Italian wedding cookies are delicious, and the dark chocolate florentine is an unexpected delight even for coconut haters like me. We will definitely be returning!",
    "We ordered pizzas to take away from this place while on vacation and wanting to avoid cooking. The restaurant was located 500 meters from our accommodation. The atmosphere inside was pleasant, clean, and comfortable for dining in. The staff, particularly the friendly and attentive man who served us, was excellent. We tried various flavors including prosciutto, ham, pepperoni, onion, mushrooms, anchovies, and basil with tomato. The pizzas took around 25 to 30 minutes to be ready, and all of them were delicious. The stone-baked style, with the perfect amount of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, was delightful. The warmth of the service reflected the experience of dining in. Overall, I would rate this place five stars.",
    "Had a nice time celebrating a friend's birthday at this cozy place. Not too crowded, prompt and friendly service. Burger was decent, although slightly overcooked. Overall, a good time on Paradise road.",
    "After reading numerous positive reviews, I decided to try this place. Although the oysters were enjoyable, everything else was dry and tasteless. The cramped space and people coughing on us made it difficult to enjoy the experience. The 2 half and half baskets my boyfriend and I ordered were definitely not worth the hefty $60 price tag.",
    "Village Whiskey has the best burger in Philadelphia, as confirmed by my visit. The bartenders are excellent and knowledgeable about their wide selection of whiskeys. The drinks are a bit pricey but delicious. The Village Burger is unbelievable with its homemade thousand island dressing, bacon, and flavorful meat. The fries are also good, especially the plain duck fat fries. Be prepared for a long wait as this place gets very busy. Overall, great drinks, delectable food, and friendly staff. I would definitely return.",
    "Overall, I found this neighborhood sushi joint to be pretty good with attentive and speedy service. The roll menu is limited, but they are accommodating to custom requests. While the rolls were fine, they weren't exceptional. However, I have no real complaints and would definitely go back. It's a hidden gem for a quick and convenient sushi option near home.",
    "A hidden gem in the French Quarter, Flanagan's Pub offers a refreshing alternative to the bustling bars on Bourbon St. With friendly bartenders, a diverse mix of locals and tourists, and laid-back vibes, we found ourselves returning three times in one day. The punk rock music added to the cool atmosphere.",
    "The Daily Bread falls short in both its food quality and service. The sandwiches lack flavor and the BBQ Chicken pizza is just average. The biggest issue is the uninterested and slow service, with long wait times and a lack of urgency to assist customers. The cleanliness of the restaurant is also disappointing, with dirty tables and unaddressed trash. Overall, it's not worth returning to when there are better options like St. Louis Bread Co.",
    "Ordered delivery through Yelp, took 45 minutes. Friendly driver. BBQ chicken pizza was delicious with toppings spread out. Mozzarella sticks were deep fried, not breaded. Two free cookies were amazing, slightly undercooked. Fair price, would order again despite the wait.",
    "The gym is fabulous and offers a wide range of fitness opportunities considering its cost. The class schedule suits those with varying work start and end times, offering classes in the early morning and late afternoon. The trainers, especially in spin and row, are exceptional. The We-Fit class is a challenging workout even for the fit. The facility is currently clean, but we'll see if it stays that way as it is a new business. The women's locker room includes convenient amenities like a blow dryer and extra hair ties, which is greatly appreciated.",
    "In a hurry? Bottom line: Prestigious is FANTASTIC! Clean and professional atmosphere, knowledgeable advisor, excellent communication throughout the repair process. Perfect color match and top-notch workmanship. Highly recommend for high-quality repairs.",
    "Santa Barbara is an excellent place to eat, with quality food, exceptional customer service, and good value for money. The breakfast place is highly recommended for visitors.",
    "I finally tried this place for lunch after years of curiosity. The layout is great with an uncrowded floor and a lunch counter facing the cooks' area. The staff was busy but not rude or frazzled, and my waitress was sweet. I ordered the fried shrimp po boy dressed and enjoyed it, but the food was average for a tourist spot in the Quarter. I might go back to try one of their burgers.",
    "These people are exceptional. We've been with them for years, seen countless doctors, and they have never failed us. They are genuine animal lovers who always deliver outstanding service. Highly reliable, there's really nothing more to add!",
    "Awesome family-friendly atmosphere with delicious Po boys that feature perfectly baked bread. We tried three variations and all were incredibly tasty. The Mac 'n Cheese had a delightful spicy kick, and the service was absolutely fantastic.",
    "Absolutely amazing dining experience during my week-long trip to NOLA! Despite the wait, the Sunday Jazz Brunch and ambience kept us entertained. The staff was friendly, allowing us to take our time ordering. The food was top-notch, from the seafood gumbo to the sea bass with green beans and a delicious sauce. Dessert was a hit too. Plus, we got seated where Ronald Reagan sat on his visits! Worth every penny. Will definitely come back.",
    "If you're visiting Indianapolis and looking for a great hotel, I highly recommend this one. The parking is convenient and the hotel features stunning urban art throughout. The check-in process was smooth and the service was outstanding. Our room was luxurious with a Keurig coffee machine, large shower, comfy robes, and a comfortable California king bed. The hotel's bar, Plat 99, offers delicious drinks and dinner, and their outdoor rooftop seating area looked amazing. The location is perfect if you're attending a Pacers game, as it's just a short walk away. We also enjoyed the buffet breakfast at the Market Place downstairs. Checking out was a breeze, and the concierge was friendly and helpful. The hotel's art collection is like a modern art museum, and we spent some time exploring before leaving. Overall, we absolutely loved this hotel and will definitely stay here again when we return to Indianapolis.",
    "The establishment has a nice setting and atmosphere with various amenities. However, the service was disappointing and disorganized. The cashier made an error by adding a beer to my to-go order and I did not receive the fish taco I had ordered. The Sonoran dog I received was soggy and not comparable to food truck options. The tacos were mediocre, lacking in flavors and presentation. The place was extremely busy and loud, potentially impacting the overall experience. They were also running out of ingredients. Overall, it was a disappointing dining experience.",
    "Sam's is one of the better sports bars in Nashville, but compared to sports bars in other cities, it is mediocre. The service can be hit or miss, and the attire of some employees could be improved. The food is decent, but the beer selection is lacking. However, if you're looking to watch sports at a bar in Nashville, Sam's is a good option.",
    "Excellent location, delicious food, and the staff is very friendly. Limited seating and can get crowded during busy times, but ordering online for pick-up seems like a smart option. On a nice day, enjoy HCV in Rittenhouse Square. Great for both vegetarians and meat eaters.",
    "Terrible experience! Delayed over an hour without any notification, and their customer policy offers zero assistance or accountability. All passengers stranded at the bus stop, wasting precious time. Avoid this company at all costs!",
    "Michael & Lucy's new family restaurant is a welcome addition to Santa Claus Lane. Despite its tough location, the Tuscany design and friendly owners make it a pleasant and inviting place to dine. The food is delicious, the prices are reasonable, and the slice and salad special is worth trying. They offer a great selection of local beers on tap and have multiple HD sports TVs for sports enthusiasts. The addition of a TV for surf videos and kids shows adds to the overall appeal. The classic Ms Pac-Man game is a hit with children. It's refreshing to see Santa Claus Lane experiencing a Renaissance. Best of luck to Michael & Lucy on their new venture!",
    "Don't be discouraged by the shopping center location! Outstanding place with an exceptional staff. Curtis epitomizes superb service and genuinely cares about your dining enjoyment. Don't miss the scallops small plate, but overall, the entire dining experience is absolutely remarkable.",
    "Amazing breakfast spot! Located just a short walk from the French Quarter, this place exceeded my expectations. The bananas foster was absolutely incredible. The vibrant and lively atmosphere perfectly captures the essence of New Orleans. Highly recommended!",
    "The birthday cakes are truly amazing! However, the cupcakes and cookies upfront can occasionally be stale. Nevertheless, the staff's excellent customer service makes up for it. Overall, I highly recommend and will definitely return.",
    "I enjoyed my experience at this new restaurant despite some slow service. The margarita and cilantro chicken enchiladas were great. The outdoor seating area was pleasant. Overall, I liked it and hope they improve their flow over time. The prices are reasonable and it's a refreshing addition to the neighborhood. Hope Loco succeeds!",
    "I highly recommend going to this nail salon! Ever since I started seeing Nary, my nails have received so many compliments. The atmosphere is great, with friendly banter among the staff and clients. Make sure to book an appointment as they offer unique designs and jewels that other salons don't, making it popular and sometimes busy. If you want extravagant nails, be prepared to pay accordingly. Looking forward to my next visit in 2 weeks!",
    "Highly recommended spot in Treasure Island! The char-grilled oysters are a must-try, and the staff is fantastic. The spacious outdoor seating area is perfect, plus they welcome pets! A major win, especially for someone like me from Austin.",
    "This place offers abundant fried seafood, but comes with a surprisingly high price tag for a working class establishment. It has a typical New Orleans vibe and is suitable for a special outing with family. Unfortunately, the food falls short of expectations.",
    "Highly recommended spot with fast and friendly service, serving tasty basic breakfast dishes. The Cajun tasso omelet was fantastic, not too spicy but just right. Fluffy and delicious hash browns. Everyone left satisfied and full. Will definitely return next time.",
    "I had a wonderful time dining here with a group of four. The appetizers, including dumplings, wings, and specials, were all intriguing and flavorful. The noodles, while not as generous as a typical chinatown noodle house, were still interesting, fresh, and delicious. Additionally, the affordability and BYO policy make it a fantastic choice. Overall, a great addition to 10th street!",
    "The sandwiches at this place in St. Louis are simply the best! Friendly atmosphere and crowd make it a delight to eat here every single day.",
    "This establishment in Reno, NV is a fantastic choice for lunch or dinner. The manager, Tyler, handles his staff excellently, resulting in a great dining experience. Additionally, their pub offers an excellent variety of beers and wines.",
    "Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at Chuck E Cheese as a childless woman. The staff was efficient and attentive, ensuring minimal wait times and providing excellent service. The variety of games available at a single token was a bonus, although it did result in frequent visits to the wallet. The birthday party area was slightly crowded, but the staff took great care of the birthday kids. While I may not visit often, it was nostalgic and heartwarming to see children enjoying themselves and reliving my own memories at Chuck E Cheese.",
    "I loved this restaurant! The simple, fresh and organic food was a refreshing change from other places. They had a great selection of coffee and latte options, and their Sasquatch brew was delicious. The ambiance was casual, relaxed, and comfortable, adding to the overall enjoyable experience. The owners were amazing and friendly as well.",
    "Delicious, hormone-free ice cream! Best spot in town - cash only but worth the ATM trip.",
    "Despite facing difficulties in reaching the restaurant due to parade-related obstacles, we had a fantastic dining experience as an alternative to Rio Mar. The service was impressively professional, striking a balance between attentiveness and subtlety. Although it was disappointing that two ingredients were unavailable for their signature cocktail, we understood the circumstances being the day before Mardi Gras. The bread and butter provided were exceptional, with a crunchy exterior and a soft interior. The uniqueness of the beet salad stood out, as the greens tasted incredibly fresh. G's Choucroute was a meat lover's delight, and my crab ravioli with Meyer lemon sauce was delicately flavorful. Our dessert, bread pudding, was exactly to our liking without raisins. Overall, this was a truly memorable meal surpassing the standards set by most hotel restaurants.",
    "Amazing find on Uber Eats! Delicious food from 51st Deli, can't wait to visit in person.",
    "The Honey Apple grilled cheese sandwich at Meltdown is absolutely amazing! Friendly staff, cool decor, and delicious food. The service and atmosphere at The Meltdown in Montgomeryville doesn't measure up. Rude service, strange decor, and even had my sandwich thrown at me. Stick with Meltdown if you're a cheese lover!",
    "Great combination deals for rolls and sushi, making it super affordable. Rolls are on the smaller side, so ordering the combo is recommended for a satisfying meal. Surprisingly fresh sashimi for the price. The place is small and service is slow, but it's BYO, allowing you to bring your own drinks from downstairs while waiting.",
    "The food was good, but the service was terrible. Despite ordering orange juice for my kids, we only received it when we were almost done eating. Additionally, the fact that they only accept cash or checks was inconvenient. Overall, they need to improve their service.",
    "My recent visit was disappointing. The food quality has declined significantly, with watery salsas and poorly chopped ingredients. Even my usual favorite dish, #15, was a letdown. There has been a noticeable change in the rice and chicken quesadilla, which is now flavorless and overloaded with cheese. I hope they prioritize quality over cost-cutting.",
    "I highly recommend Stigma for tattoos! I got two tattoos by Eddie and he did an amazing job. The entire staff is friendly and accommodating, especially with my back issues. I also received a discount through Yelp and bought their tattoo ointment, which is soothing. Overall, great artists and great experience.",
    "This place is a blast! With its outdoor patio playing hip hop and an indoor dance area with salsa, you can easily switch up the music and scenery whenever you feel like it.",
    "Great decor and wait staff, but the portions were small. The fish special was delicious, but the fattoush salad was disappointing with limp lettuce and no olives. Pricey for lunch, won't be returning.",
    "The Animal Clinic is our top choice for all our pet's needs. They genuinely care for our animals as if they were their own. The only downside is the slightly inconvenient location.",
    "This Taco Bell was an extremely disappointing experience. The restaurant's hygiene was unacceptable, the service was terrible, and our orders were consistently incorrect. I strongly advise against visiting this location and suggest exploring other dining options instead.",
    "I enjoyed the Neuvo-Latino-American food at this place, which has relocated and expanded. The Chips & Salsa were consistently fresh and delicious. However, as I haven't visited the new location or dined there recently, I won't provide further commentary.",
    "I stumbled upon Player's while driving and had a fantastic experience! The staff is friendly, service is top-notch, and the atmosphere is wonderfully laid-back. I received an excellent shave and haircut at a great price. Overall, a great find!",
    "The food at this restaurant was terrible, particularly the frogs legs which were rubbery and tasted awful. The manager's rude behavior when I attempted to return my meal was absolutely shocking. Her actions left me disgusted and she should be deeply ashamed. I have never encountered such horrible treatment from anyone.",
    "The location is isolated with limited dining options nearby, and the building is showing its age. The room had noticeable cleanliness issues with torn wallpaper, unclean floor, and water spots in the bathroom. The hallways were eerie, reminiscent of \"red rum\". However, the bed was comfortable and the room, although disappointing compared to other Doubletree hotels, was functional.",
    "This boutique hotel is beautifully designed with a unique charm that sets it apart from typical hotels like the Hilton. I had my birthday party at the restaurant and it was a wonderful experience. The service was excellent and the rooms are stunning. The only downside was a slightly loud air conditioner in our room. However, its close proximity to the vibrant Printers Alley makes it even more appealing. I would certainly choose to stay in this hotel again.",
    "This spot is amazing! The location is fantastic and it's not overcrowded if you go early. The bartenders are awesome and they made me the most amazing Perfect Rye Manhattan on the rocks. I'm officially hooked. And the burger? Hands down, the best I've ever had. I will definitely be returning.",
    "This breakfast place is simply outstanding! The food is excellent, and the service matches its high quality. The biscuits and gravy, extra crispy bacon, sausage links, and challah French toast made it my new favorite breakfast spot.",
    "We were pleased with Terra's work as our wedding florist. She took the time to understand our needs and accommodate our budget. The florals were beautiful, and we loved the draping for the ceremony and reception. However, some flowers in the bouquets wilted during the day, possibly due to the heat. Overall, we were happy with Terra for our wedding.",
    "NOLA's healthy dining spot with great to-go options! Enjoyed the delicious turkey meatballs and spaghetti for a wonderful lunch.",
    "This take-out food in Northern Liberties is everything I desire - fresh, delicious, and surprisingly healthy. It's a rare find in this area, and the convenience is a huge bonus.",
    "I attended an alumni event at this cozy, dimly lit venue that is beautifully decorated like an old library. The ambiance was perfect for a quiet and casual evening. The drink selection was limited to a few beers and wines, but their happy hour cocktails, including Moscow mules and old fashioneds, were outstanding. Everyone enjoyed their drinks, and we had no complaints.",
    "The burgers are incredible, and the onion rings are a must-have.",
    "My dining experience at this restaurant was consistently disappointing. The steak was overly salty, the fish was dry, and even my salad was frozen. The service was also terrible. I don't understand how this place manages to receive any positive reviews.",
    "Modesto in St. Louis is a standout Spanish restaurant, even among the many excellent options in NYC. It's a fantastic place that I truly miss since moving away.",
    "I had a terrible experience at Spa Aria. The receptionist was unattentive, the staff was unhelpful, and the spa was small and dirty. The nail technician was sick, which was unsanitary, and gave a rushed and subpar manicure. The hand/arm massage was awful and the technician made snarky comments about my dry skin. The receptionist was also unprofessional and there were extra fees for putting services on my room. Overall, I would not recommend Spa Aria and suggest going elsewhere.",
    "I highly recommend their hot shave - it exceeded my expectations! The experience was fantastic with 6 towels and a soothing facial massage using luxurious oils. The shave itself was top-notch, and the environment was exceptional.",
    "Taco del Mar is a consistently decent and fast build-your-own burrito and taco place. Owned by Subway, it has a similar vibe but boasts higher quality. With fresh and well-stocked ingredients, there are numerous vegetarian options available. Personal favorite is a veggie burrito loaded with lots of veggies accompanied by their tasty chips and \"medium\" salsa. If in the area, Taco del Mar is worth checking out, especially for vegetarians.",
    "This store is only suitable as a backup when Trader Joe's doesn't have what I need. It is overpriced and lacks sufficient staff, making it quite disappointing. Overall, not recommended.",
    "If you're looking for fall-off-the-bone tender ribs, this barbecue joint may not be for you. The smoked ribs here are intentionally a bit tough, which may not suit everyone's taste.",
    "This place is a hidden gem for lassi and chaat lovers. The elegantly presented Karachi-style chaat is a taste of tradition, but it pales in comparison to their exceptional lassi. The lassi is absolutely heavenly, with its smooth, creamy texture and perfectly balanced sweetness. A definite must-visit when I'm in the area again.",
    "We had a breathtaking wedding reception at Hendel's Cafe - a truly perfect evening shared with loved ones.",
    "Terrible experience overall. Cockroach infestation, archaic wifi, and extortionate charges for a private beach. Will definitely avoid this place in the future.",
    "El Sol exceeded our expectations for my daughter's birthday celebration. The attentive service, delectable drinks and food, and the staff's surprise of a large cake, dessert, sombreros, and even fireworks made it truly unforgettable. We're thrilled to have found this gem nearby and look forward to returning for regular dinner visits. Plus, the generous portion of fajitas ensured a delicious lunch the next day as well. Great job, guys!",
    "Taco Son is a hidden gem of a restaurant that offers delicious, made-from-scratch food without the long lines like other popular places. The freshness of the ingredients shines through in every bite, and their generous portions ensure you get your money's worth. Don't miss out on their killer breakfast burritos, perfect for a post-night out treat.",
    "I recently purchased a used car from this dealership for my son. Although it didn't come with a warranty due to its age, I expected it to be in a safe condition. However, the front left tire blew the very next day after bringing it home. The tire was completely dry rotted on the backside, which could have resulted in a major accident. The tire shop had to replace both front tires for $450. This experience has made me reconsider recommending this dealership.",
    "The food is excellent, but the bathrooms were in poor condition, deducting 1 star.",
    "Great food, but unfortunately, the service was extremely disappointing. Despite ordering online and arriving on time, my food wasn't even started until I got to the restaurant. I had to wait the entire cooking time and received no compensation for the inconvenience. The lack of customer service was truly disappointing.",
    "I recently discovered a cute Japanese restaurant in Old City that I absolutely love! Not only do they serve fresh sushi and amazing ramen, but their customer service is top-notch. It has quickly become my go-to spot for sushi and ramen, thanks to their great menu selection.",
    "The ambiance was delightful and I thoroughly enjoyed being pampered and feeling relaxed. However, it was difficult to place a drink order, which was the only reason I didn't give them a perfect score. I had to ask four different people before being directed to use the white phone to call room service.",
    "Dr. Jeffers is a compassionate and knowledgeable vet with reasonable prices and excellent diagnostic equipment. She even accepts reptiles and has animals available for adoption. Highly recommend her practice. A top-notch vet comparable to Dr. Pol.",
    "Great Mahi Mahi with a generous portion size, perfect for sharing. Ideal if you enjoy smoked fish. The server was friendly and pleasant.",
    "Melissa is the best lash technician I've come across. Unlike others, she doesn't overload lashes and works efficiently. I highly recommend booking with her.",
    "The best casino in Reno! Their 4 deck and 2 deck blackjack options are a gambler's dream. Say goodbye to plastic cups, they serve drinks in real glasses. The dazzling decor will leave you in awe. The in-house restaurants outshine those on the strip by a thousand-fold. The rooms are top-notch for the price, especially the ones with hot tubs. Chill out and enjoy!",
    "My wife and I finally made it to this restaurant and it was worth the wait. The fish and chips were crispy and flavorful, with a moist and juicy fish. The portion size was good, but not huge. The homemade tartar sauce added a great touch. The salmon tacos had great flavors, although the salmon was slightly overcooked. The serving size of the tacos was small, but the flavors were delicious. If you're looking for a satisfying meal of appropriate size, this place is highly recommended.",
    "The Lemon Cake at Cake Life is a heavyweight in terms of both size and taste. Despite opting out of cupcakes, the decision was justified as their cakes are simply outstanding. Their cakes rock, and I can't wait for more visits in the future.",
    "Terrible service, extremely slow, and disorganized. Manager's attempt to make things right fell short. Not worth a visit, find better options. Avoid at all costs.",
    "Wildflower is a charming restaurant with delicious food made with fresh, local ingredients. Although the menu is limited for vegetarians, the dishes they offer are great. The Vermonter salad and tuna plate were both enjoyable, and the homemade honey butter was a highlight. The patio is cute and cozy, and the servers are wonderful. The homemade red velvet cupcake was a delightful birthday surprise. Overall, a fantastic experience and a place worth revisiting for breakfast as well.",
    "Terrible roast pork sandwich with lifeless broccoli rabe and freezing temperatures. Cheese didn't even melt, bread was soggy. Avoid, unless you're stuck in an airport.",
    "I decided to try this place based on the reviews and price. The appetizers were great, but the entrees were disappointing. The Pad Thai was too sweet and lacked spiciness. The other dishes were mediocre. However, considering the low price of each entree, you get what you pay for. Despite not enjoying it as much as I hoped, I'm glad it wasn't expensive.",
    "This place is a must-visit for sandwich enthusiasts! Made-to-order, delicious food and worth the wait. Definitely deserves five stars. Well done!",
    "The Devils Food Cake with vanilla buttercream icing was absolutely delicious! Despite being calorie-conscious, all 12 adults devoured every last bite. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, and we were thrilled to discover a location closer to us in Old City. Can't praise our experience enough - only wish we could have another slice of that amazing cake!",
    "Great talent, but poor time management. Arrived at 11:28am and still waiting for service despite opening at 11am. Disappointed with Perfect Arch.",
    "Spasso in Media is highly recommended for a great dinner experience. The service provided by Oana is outstanding, with her extensive knowledge of the menu and willingness to assist. They offer a unique twist on Italian cuisine, with delicious starters like the refreshing eggplant/pepper topping. The Caesar salad is perfect, and the pappardelle porcini dish is a must-try, with its flavorful combination of sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, and chicken. Grabbing a high top in the bar area was a great decision, as there was no wait despite being full service. Don't miss out on this gem in Media!",
    "I have been a member of this credit union for 4 years, along with my family. Despite some occasional errors, we have been quite satisfied with their service. The branch has been helpful in promptly resolving any issues we encountered.",
    "Unfortunately, despite multiple visits, we cannot recommend this place. The atmosphere is consistently rowdy and drinks have been spilled on us numerous times. Service is slow regardless of the time or location, and the food is average for the high prices. Our orders often take much longer than promised, and the management's response is unhelpful and dismissive. The staff is rude and inattentive, despite there being an excessive number of employees. We will not be returning and advise others to find a more reliable and enjoyable establishment.",
    "The best Mexican food in St Pete! It may be small, but the flavors are incredible. Avoid the weekend rush and go on a weekday. The chorizo tacos are a meat lover's dream and the fish tacos are fantastic for seafood enthusiasts.",
    "Chatham Tap is the best spot for wings in Indianapolis. The meaty wings, delicious sauce, and generous portions make it a must-try. The menu offers a variety of options, and the onion rings are a highlight. The sports atmosphere is fantastic, accommodating fans of all sports, and the service is top-notch. A highly recommended place for a fantastic meal, excellent service, and a fun time with friends.",
    "Very tasty sushi at affordable prices with quick service. Just one suggestion: adding menu photos for a better dining experience. Authentic flavor and ultra healthy.",
    "Had a wonderful first experience at this restaurant tonight. Our server, Alison, was fantastic, assisting us throughout the evening. We appreciated not feeling rushed as we caught up with friends. The food, from steaks to meatloaf, was delicious and prepared perfectly. Excited to return and hope for the same amazing experience.",
    "I've been going to Jonny's dive bar for years and it's great. Amazing happy hour, laid back atmosphere, and surprisingly delicious food. The homemade dough and naked wings are a must-try. They also offer games like trivia and bingo, with awesome prizes including 1 cent pitchers of beer. Just be aware that it's a smoking bar and can get crowded on game days. Overall, a fantastic spot for cheap drinks, half-price pizza, and hanging out with friends.",
    "Amazing food, with vegan options available. Friendly servers and spacious restaurant with a bar and stage area. Perfect for hosting events, as our work Holiday parties have been a hit here for the past couple of years. The guacamole is particularly outstanding.",
    "West Ave. Grill is a happy and charming spot in Jenkintown, popular among locals who enjoy dining outside with their dogs and children. The restaurant offers both a large and small indoor area, complete with a bar overlooking the parking lot and the nicer part of Jenkintown town square. The friendly wait staff and often present owner contribute to the welcoming atmosphere. Upon leaving, customers are offered complimentary Dum Dum lolly pops and newspapers to enjoy. The food at West Ave. Grill is consistently good, with highlights including fluffy and crispy pancakes and the delicious Kansas City breakfast. The only downside is that the big salads could benefit from a bit more variety and ingredients. However, the staff is attentive and always willing to make things right. Overall, it's a nice place worth trying out.",
    "Fantastic hot chicken! First time visiting and it was absolutely amazing. Hands down the best hot chicken I've ever had. Definitely a must-stop every time we come to Nashville.",
    "The tuna melt at this cafe is simply the best I've ever had - clean and delicious! The service is outstanding, even surpassing other cafes. Surprisingly located inside a grocery store, they should consider expanding independently. An amazing experience overall!",
    "Finally, a great spot in Stl for saut\u00e9ed seafood in a plastic bag! The sauce is delicious and the service is top-notch.",
    "Extremely disappointing experience at this particular fast-food chain. Despite low expectations, none of the items I requested from the drive-thru menu were available. This made me apprehensive about the quality of the eventual order. Remembering the movie \"Waiting,\" I strongly advise avoiding this arch. To emphasize the point, I was merely attempting to order a beverage, which is quite unfortunate.",
    "This place has amazing gravy fries, friendly staff, and a great atmosphere for watching sports. Good beer selection as well.",
    "We had a fun and festive time at the bar, with Santa and Mrs. Claus making a brief appearance. The service was a bit slow, but we didn't mind as we wanted to take our time. Overall, it's a great place for a drink or two with a nice ambiance.",
    "We stumbled upon this gem in South Tucson and it was a delightful departure from the chain hotel dining options near the airport. The restaurant, a converted A & W fast food stand from the 1960s, served us a fantastic meal at a reasonable price. I opted for the catfish smothered in poblano sauce and melted cheese, and it brought back childhood memories of catching fish from a nearby lake. The freshness of the chile relleno impressed my wife. Our young companions also enjoyed their enchiladas and chimichangas. A great find recommended by fellow Yelpers!",
    "This restaurant offers delicious and authentic Indian dishes, with the vegetable pakora being a highlight. The entrees, such as chicken tikki masala and lamb vindaloo, were superb and true to their flavors. The sauces were incredibly tasty. The prices were reasonable, although the staff/service was average. Overall, a great addition to the dining options in Media, especially with their promising lunch buffet at an affordable price.",
    "I highly recommend Howard for all your Volkswagen needs. Despite the slight delay in getting an appointment, he surpasses expectations with his thoroughness, reliability, knowledge, and efficiency.",
    "The desserts are simply incredible, especially the Dark and Sinister. The chocolate ice cream creations are my absolute favorite.",
    "The oyster happy hour from 5-7pm was fantastic! My boyfriend and I enjoyed a dozen oysters and a glass of champagne for only $24, including tip. It was great value and the staff were friendly and attentive. We even missed out on their renowned to-go cups. We felt casual and at home. Definitely going back!",
    "Prep & Pastry is a must-visit spot with incredible food and a bustling atmosphere. Arrive early or late to avoid the long wait, but trust me, it's worth it. Their green eggs & ham, bloody marys, and mimosas are to die for. The staff even surprised me with a delectable birthday pastry, although I can't recall its name. Plus, they serve locally roasted EXO coffee, elevating the breakfast experience to perfection.",
    "Great spot with a wide selection of coffees and teas, including the amazing iced dirty chai. Friendly staff and spacious tables cater to a comfortable experience. Don't miss the opportunity to appreciate and purchase local artists' work. The overall vibe is very enjoyable.",
    "The worker was outstanding; however, the expensive price does not align with the service provided. While the worker is motivated by hourly pay, I suggest exploring hiring alternatives such as outsourcing services. Overall, hiring someone off craigslist and paying them for the service might be a more cost-effective option.",
    "The new Bacon-Bleu cheeseburger is hands down one of the best fast food burgers I've had in a while! Dave Thomas would be proud!",
    "I had a decent experience at this place a few months ago. The carrot cake was good enough, but not the best. The packaging was excessive and the price was high. The atmosphere is unique and appealing, especially for a girls' outing. However, the service was disappointing. We waited a while for our order and had to flag down the teenager to box it up. The wait staff seemed too busy despite the lack of customers. Overall, I give four stars for the cake and two stars for the service.",
    "I highly recommend this place for its amazing food and exceptional service. The burgers and pulled pork are the best we've had in the Reno/Sparks area. It has definitely become our go-to spot.",
    "The Smoked Salmon Frittata at this spot is as good as it sounds. The combination of smoked salmon, egg, potato, red bell peppers, goat cheese, horseradish-dill crema, and fresh fruit is delicious. Highly recommend for brunch, dinner, or private dining.",
    "Dinner for 9 was an amazing experience! Celebrating a 70th birthday, we were treated with top-notch service throughout. Though pricey, the steaks and entrees were exceptional. Excellent service, delicious food, and a wonderful ambiance.",
    "The food is amazing, especially the fried pickles and smash fries! However, the customer service was horrible.",
    "I had high expectations based on recommendations, but was disappointed. Parking was difficult and we waited 30 minutes for our 5 tacos, which were lukewarm at best. Taste was average, with the buffalo chicken being underwhelming and the shrimp mediocre. Overall, not worth the wait and effort. Unlikely to return.",
    "I joined the MBSC thrive program at City Fitness and found it lacking in personalized training. The trainers have a set program and you have little input. Sessions can be crowded, and you may have to wait for the trainer. The sessions are intense but lack consistency, making it hard to master the moves. The atmosphere and music cater to a younger demographic. If you want to push yourself without personal attention, MBSC might be for you. However, if you prefer individualized training and learning about muscle groups, it may not be the best fit. Consider trying an introductory program before committing to the pricey monthly fee. I rate MBSC at City Fitness 1.5 stars for an overall rating of 2.5 stars.",
    "This place offers decent BBQ with a large, tasty cheeseburger. However, the pork sandwich was soggy and the meat was bland. The BBQ sauce is good, but not outstanding. The Mac & Cheese tasted okay but the noodles were overcooked. Overall, it's worth a visit if you're in the area. 4/5 stars for price.",
    "This Indian buffet offers a wide selection of dishes at a reasonable price. While it may not have any standout dishes, it provides many good options. Would consider returning.",
    "Unwelcoming staff, denied use of guest pass, forced to buy expensive day pass. Opted for Retro fitness instead, offering free trial and superior equipment/environment.",
    "Brixx is a winner for pizza lovers like me! Their menu offers gluten-free and lunch options, which I appreciate as a picky eater. The bar is a great spot to relax after work, but be sure to arrive early since their patio gets filled up quickly.",
    "Great options for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans. Haven't been disappointed yet. A healthy place to dine.",
    "Initially, the frozen yogurt at this location in Central Bucks was the best I had found. The staff was friendly and the flavors were enjoyable. However, I have now discovered a rival location that proves to be equally impressive.",
    "I absolutely loved my stay at this apartment complex in St. Petersburg, FL. The serene environment, surrounded by lakes, was truly amazing. The leasing office staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. I had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend this apartment to anyone seeking a peaceful stay.",
    "This place is a must-visit in NOLA! It has a charming prohibition-era vibe with a fantastic jazz band. The Vieux Carre cocktail was excellent. Don't miss the cozy room to relax and sip your drink.",
    "We finally tried the sushiritos at the new location and had mixed feelings. The slammin' salmon had too much sauce, overpowering the fresh ingredients. The Japanese fried chicken was a little dry and the sauce was too sweet and sour. The green tea and lemonade were decent, but not worth visiting for. The high price for a gimmicky meal made us hesitant to return.",
    "Enzo's is a solid takeout choice with a delicious meatball sub and tasty garlic knots. While I preferred nabruzzi's pizza, I'll continue ordering from Enzo's for their homemade meatballs. I do miss the old pizza options though.",
    "I stumbled upon the best burger joint on earth in Philly! Thanks to Alya & the Bareburger team for the healthy and delicious experience. Andrew von Gregor, LA guitarist.",
    "Cosi is my go-to spot when traveling, and I have enjoyed dining at this particular location multiple times. Their flatbreads and salads are delicious, especially the BBQ chicken flatbread. The portion sizes are quite satisfying.",
    "I used to love this place when it was just one store on Linbergh with the owner. However, since they started expanding, both the food and service have declined. I won't be returning.",
    "Terrible experience - awful egg roll and chewy sushi. Not surprised to be the only customer.",
    "Overall, the hotel is a great choice for those looking to stay on Bourbon street. The staff is friendly and the food choices are good. The rooms are spacious and nice. However, be cautious of room 263 as it is closer to the vending and ice machines, leading to thin walls which allow for noise from conversations in the hallway to be heard. If not for this issue, I would have given the hotel a 4-star rating.",
    "Overall, my experience at Ocharleys on a Sunday afternoon was disappointing. Despite the lack of crowd, our server seemed overwhelmed and forgot several items, such as bread, fries, and our coupon. It took a long time to get simple things like a Sprite refill, and the manager had to fix the billing error. I might consider giving Ocharleys another chance for lunch instead of dinner.",
    "This place is a disappointment. The service is terrible and the food is overpriced and mediocre. I had hoped my first experience was just an off night, but the second visit was equally disappointing. There is nothing innovative about this place, and they don't seem to care about the high prices they charge. I would recommend saving this one for the tourists.",
    "Unfortunately, there is no 12-step program specifically designed to manage a Reanimator Coffee problem.",
    "Wow! What a lucky find! With two meaderies within such a close distance, we are truly spoilt for choice. The meads at this new establishment are absolutely perfect. We tried Goober Vitis, Suzy's Cherry Pie, and the coffee flavor, and they were all exceptional. The flavors are pure and the aromas are delightful. The spacious interior with big tables and an L-shaped bar, along with picnic tables outside, make for a very pleasant visit.",
    "I highly recommend Pina's for their diverse menu, excellent seafood options, and flawless service. The dinner specials, cheesesteaks, calzones, and seafood dishes are my personal favorites. The shrimp scampi appetizer (minus linguini) and steamed clams are both delicious and reasonably priced. Overall, Pina's is a great choice for a casual dining experience.",
    "Chatham is a great spot to watch football. The $4 Guiness and Black and Tans on Tuesdays were a bonus. Their fish and chips were a pleasant surprise with a unique, soft texture. Overall, a fantastic pub to catch a game and enjoy some good food.",
    "This nail salon is a hidden gem! After trying numerous salons in Tampa, my friend and I finally found this place on Instagram. We will never go anywhere else again. Despite the long drive, it is absolutely worth it. Both Pamela and Steven are incredibly talented and have successfully brought our design visions to life. A huge thank you to them for their amazing work!",
    "Belinda and Jerry were incredibly helpful and kind during my storage experience in Boise. As a travel nurse, I needed a place to leave my car for the winter. Belinda stayed and waited for me on a snowy December evening, while Jerry drove me to my storage shed and assisted with my luggage. I am extremely satisfied with the service I received and highly recommend them!",
    "Unique is a highly professional and reputable company that operates with utmost integrity. They are responsive, transparent, and honest in their dealings. Their technicians are efficient, clean, and pleasant to work with. Pricing is extremely fair and the quality of their work is exceptional. Based on my direct experience with their sales person (Mike P) and manager Chris, I can confidently recommend them. Additionally, comparing their prices to similar-sized companies is encouraged.",
    "Great food, fast service, and convenient delivery to my door. Friendly staff who make delicious pizza. Highly recommended.",
    "The street tacos were excellent, the service was great, and the hand-made horchata was a delightful addition. Top-notch stop overall.",
    "I had a disappointing experience at this salon. The manicure took too long, my hands look terrible, and the work was not checked. On the positive side, my student was nice and the pedicure was good. However, I feel that I shouldn't have been charged for the manicure or at least had someone redo it. Overall, I rate it 2 stars.",
    "Excellent experience at this Chinese and sushi restaurant. The ambiance was lovely with a nice, quiet, and dark setting. We tried the szechuan chicken, hot and sour soup, and steamed rice which were all delicious. My husband enjoyed the prime rib and shrimp hot pot. The portion sizes were just right, and we didn't have to take any leftovers home. The service was exceptional.",
    "Frank is a fantastic dentist and a genuinely kind individual. He possesses a gentle approach and a sincere concern for his patients. Overall, he is a top-notch dentist and an excellent choice for anyone seeking dental care. I have been going to him for years, and I know numerous others who have done the same.",
    "Great spot with stylish sidewalk lounge seating, an awesome DJ playing outside on Friday nights, and a convenient walk-up bar. The interior decor is impressive, and the appetizers we tried were delicious. Located in a trendy waterfront area.",
    "The Friday happy hour special at this place is a fantastic deal! Surprisingly not crowded, the food and drinks on offer were incredibly delicious. The pork sliders and beignets for dessert are a must-try. We had a really enjoyable time with a great atmosphere, and the staff was super friendly.",
    "I had a fantastic experience at this place. The service was outstanding, the food was fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere was beautiful. Lisa, our host, was amazing and made our evening even more enjoyable. We will definitely be returning soon!",
    "I've visited Lush stores in multiple locations, but the one in New Orleans is my favorite. The scent of the store can be detected from a block away, which I love. I've visited this specific store several times, always on Halloween, and it's always a fun experience.",
    "I absolutely love this place for happy hour and dinner! The Asian Nachos are a must-try, they're practically a meal on their own. The other happy hour dishes are also fantastic. The creme brulee and other desserts are amazing. The blueberry mojito and mango sling are both delicious. It's a great spot for celebrating birthdays and has a nice atmosphere. Just be prepared for the bar area to get crowded during happy hour. The only downside is finding parking, which can be a hassle like most places around the mall.",
    "Delicious top shelf pastries with exceptional service. Shocked by the low ratings. If you prioritize flavor over cheapness, this is your spot. As an extremely demanding customer, I've always received great service. Can't wait for them to create macaroons for our wedding.",
    "Although the ingredients were fresh and the service was great, the pizza at this place was disappointing. The crust was too thin, resulting in a cold pizza within minutes. It was also floppy and lacked flavor. With several other pizzerias in the area, I won't be returning.",
    "Overall, I had mixed feelings about my first visit to bier. While I appreciated their constantly rotating taps, I was a bit disappointed that I only found two beers that I liked, with only one being truly memorable. The tap room, however, was lively and engaging, with people continuously trying out different beers and engaging in conversation. Despite my initial let down, I believe bier has the potential to improve and I am open to giving them a higher rating in the future. 3 stars for now, with hope for better experiences ahead.",
    "Sweet Confections on Magazine St had a beautifully sweet ending to our trip to NOLA. After a delicious lunch at Cochon, we stumbled upon this charming spot. We tried a chocolate cupcake with mocha filling and truffles in raspberry, creme brulee, and orange flavors. The cupcake was good, but the mocha filling stole the show. The raspberry truffle was my favorite, with its perfect balance of dark chocolate. The coffee was a delightful chaser, not too overpowering, and I didn't even need milk or sugar. The seating was nice, with enough room for our group of six. The service was great, with helpful staff suggesting flavors and labeling. I give it 4 out of 5 stars, as having one more staff member would benefit the overall service.",
    "The pulled pork sandwich was delicious, but the Lucky Bun (Asian fusion style) burger was a disappointment due to the use of a frozen beef patty. The bread, toppings, and sauces were excellent, but the processed patty hindered the flavors. Using fresh ground meat would have made it a great gourmet burger.",
    "This place is perfect for kids - it's like a tea party with delicious treats like homemade doughnuts, popsicles, and cake. I've tried everything, and my favorites are the red bean filled doughnuts, popsicles, patbingsu and the classic coffee with cream and sugar.",
    "Always awesome! This place has the best crust, fresh ingredients, and a friendly staff. They offer unique toppings not found elsewhere. Don't miss out on their delicious salads. The patio area is perfect for relaxing with a beer or glass of wine while enjoying the best pizza in town.",
    "I highly recommend this gas station. Being the only one on Clearwater Beach that's open 24/7, it's my go-to place for guests, and I love it.",
    "This place in St. Pete is absolutely amazing. Everything on the menu is delicious and will surely leave you in a food coma.",
    "This Chipotle location was amazing! I loved that they acknowledged teachers during Teacher Appreciation Week. The service was excellent with a minimal wait time, unlike another Chipotle branch. The food was consistently fresh, flavorful, and satisfying. Personally, I always go for the bowl with white cilantro lime rice, black beans, steak, and all the toppings. Don't forget to pair it with their delicious tortilla chips!",
    "Just another typical Jimmy Johns - average food, average experience, but cleanliness was commendable.",
    "I recently vacationed in St. Petersburg with my family and Dooners was by far the best meal we had. The food was excellent and the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. Highly recommend and would definitely go again.",
    "The bar attached to the Alexander Hotel is a must-visit. With a menu featuring vintage pre-prohibition cocktails, the standout is \"The Elephant in the Room,\" a bourbon cocktail served in a decanter filled with cherrywood smoke. You control how long it infuses, adding to the experience. The comfortable seating and spacious deck, complete with heating, provide a great spot to enjoy the bustling street below. Additionally, you can watch people work out at the CityWay YMCA through the glass. Don't miss the truffle oil and sea salt popcorn - it's addictive! Grab a beer and start collecting bags - you won't be able to resist.",
    "This Philadelphia hotel is a gem. Cozy, modern rooms with chic decor that feels like a friend's apartment. Free breakfast delivered to your door and 24/7 lobby access to coffee, tea, water, and fruit. Polite and helpful staff. Some difficulty with parking and limited view from the room. Highly recommended.",
    "I was introduced to this place by a Colombian friend who had a craving for something inexpensive yet delicious. It reminds me of Nanzhou, a popular spot on Yelp, as you get generous portions for a fraction of the price. I tried the oxtail soup (Sancocho) with extra rice and plantains, and it was equally satisfying as the Korean-style I usually have. The broth was thicker and the potatoes were beefier. My friend devoured the flat steak (Carne Asada) in less than 10 seconds. Don't miss out on this gem in NE Philly, Yelp!",
    "My friends and I tried all the available flavors and loved the range of fun donut options. However, the standout for me was the fried chicken. The chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious and highly recommended.",
    "The pricing is steep, but the food is absolutely delicious. The cozy space is a little tricky to locate, but worth it. The green eggs and ham breakfast biscuit is a must-try, although slightly pricey at around $10. The Santa Barbara tri tip sandwich is excellent, and the cold brew coffee is good. The grab and go section offers plenty of tasty options, including the fantastic salami and pesto sandwich. Overall, a place worth revisiting.",
    "The food is delicious, but the service is consistently slow or poor, despite not being busy most of the time.",
    "This Indian restaurant is one of my favorites. The atmosphere may not be impressive, but the food is absolutely delicious. Prompt seating and pleasant service make for a casual dining experience. The naan is soft and the original flavor is my preference. Regardless of your choice of entree, you can't go wrong. It may not be as spicy as I like, but the flavors are great for those who enjoy medium spice. I recommend the Masala or Vindaloo (Chicken, Shrimp, Lamb... your choice). Don't forget to try the Rice Pudding and Gulab Jaman, mixed together for a creamy and sugary treat.",
    "The burger at Goleta Holester Ave is absolutely outstanding, making it the best burger I've ever had. Despite its unremarkable surroundings, it is definitely worth a visit for this exceptional culinary experience.",
    "This stadium has major flaws. The lack of vendors means you have to constantly get up for food and drinks. The \"hoagies\" and fries are terrible - greasy and soggy. The low-quality TVs make it hard to watch the game while waiting. Empty beer containers everywhere just a few innings in is unacceptable. And be warned, Philly fans are rude and disrespectful. Overall, skip this stadium and bring your own food if you do decide to go.",
    "Absolutely loved this place! The old school diner vibe is fantastic and the staff is exceptionally friendly. Even though I've never had gumbo before, they made us delightful tasters that were impossible to resist. Surprisingly, I devoured every bite despite not being a fan of shrimp. The grits, fried chicken, and split pea soup were also to die for. Honestly, the split pea soup here is the best I've ever had. Unbelievably affordable prices too - we had a feast with beers for just $25. Amazing deal!",
    "This jewelry store is a hidden gem! Ali and Albisia are talented and delightful owners who create stunning and one-of-a-kind pieces. The store's ambiance, complemented by great music and a glass of wine, adds to the overall experience. I'm already planning my next visit to Tampa just to see them again!",
    "The menu and ingredients at this place are good, but their sandwich-making skills fall short. I tried their Turkey and Brie Wrap and the Spinach Florentine Wrap, both of which were poorly assembled and resembled crumples rather than wraps. The staff seemed confused and unenthusiastic. Additionally, clearer signage for ordering, picking up, and paying would be greatly appreciated.",
    "This place is amazing! The employees are attentive and the desserts are crafted perfectly. The banana puddings have three/four delicious layers and the texture is smooth. The upside pineapple cake is bomb, with just the right amount of pineapple flavor. The only downside was the caramelized pineapple bottom being a bit hard to chew. Highly recommend this bakery for its great service and tasty desserts.",
    "I highly recommend the new Paoli location for their delicious and diverse selection of donuts. Unlike the dull options at Dunkin, these donuts are true beauties. I especially loved the Salted Caramel, Bacon Maple, and Lemon flavors. Additionally, they offer a variety of breakfast sandwiches, muffins, and bagels. Absolutely worth a visit!",
    "Our second chance at Hermitage O'Charley's was absolutely wonderful. Despite being seated in the bar on a busy night, the server was attentive and had a great personality. The food arrived quickly, well prepared, and delicious. We have returned multiple times since and the service has consistently been great.",
    "I am absolutely delighted with my haircut! The prices are incredibly reasonable too. Although the color wasn't exactly what I had hoped for during my first visit, it still turned out great. This is my second time here and I'll definitely keep coming back.",
    "Meticulous attention to healthy, delectable cuisine with flavorful twists and thoughtful details. Extensive menu, accommodating dietary needs effortlessly. Outstanding sauces and exquisite desserts incorporating white and black sticky rice. A definitive choice for Thai cuisine going forward!",
    "Fantastic neighborhood grocery store with excellent deli, soup, hot bar, and salad bar choices. Affordable alternative to Whole Foods. Impressive weekend crawfish and lobster boils. A definite go-to store for locals. Plus, their fried chicken is absolutely amazing!",
    "I created my Yelp account solely to review this place and it truly exceeded my expectations. This local cafe/coffee shop delivers exactly what you'd hope for and more. The food and coffee were superb, and the friendly and casual atmosphere made for a delightful experience. The Victorian architecture of the dining room added to the charm. Although service was slow, the personable barista made up for it. It's the perfect spot to unwind, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter. Their dog-friendly policy was a bonus. Situated in the French quarter, it's a great location. I just wish I could've visited more than once during my trip to New Orleans.",
    "The teas offered are of good quality, but their prices are excessively high. Consider exploring alternatives such as Republic of Tea or Twinings, which offer great options at more reasonable prices.",
    "Unfortunately, Millers did not live up to expectations. Despite convenient location, ample parking, and spacious tables with a fireplace for ambiance, the consistently long wait times suggested a less than average dining experience. The guacamole portion was huge but lacked flavor, while the zinger boneless wings were enjoyable, along with the attractive hostesses. The server was pleasant and attentive, addressing issues promptly. However, the wilted side salad was disappointing and the main dishes lacked flavor and presentation. The plastic dishes and high price for a lackluster experience were discouraging. The desire for dessert was overshadowed by the risk of disappointment. Overall, the experience did not meet expectations, and the reviewer does not plan to return for dining in, although the husband might order wings for takeout.",
    "I have been coming to this facility for 6 months due to my membership, but I am constantly disappointed. The facilities are nice, but the staff does not do a good job. I always have to ask them to re-vacuum or wipe everything down as they do not clean cup holders or door kick panels. It is frustrating, and some of the staff on the vacuum side do not speak English, making it even more difficult to communicate. It's a shame because the location is perfect for me, but the quality is lacking.",
    "I had a great experience at The Libertine. They use fresh ingredients, even down to the crushed ice which they make right at the bar. The only issue I had was identifying the men's restroom due to similar-looking dimly lit pictures.",
    "Family-friendly and highly recommended, this pizza joint did not disappoint. As a self-proclaimed pizza connoisseur, I can confidently say this place ranks among the best. The staff was friendly and the food arrived promptly. A solid experience overall - I would gladly return and recommend it to others.",
    "At the Collingswood Art Festival, we tried these pricey yet absolutely worth it fried cheddar curds. They are not greasy at all and have a perfect flavor. Once you have a taste, you'll be craving them again. The light batter doesn't overpower the deliciously stringy and melty cheese. The sauces provided are a delightful addition. An indulgence that is definitely worth the price.",
    "Yats is a must-visit spot with a variety of delicious options served in generous portions. The affordable prices and vegetarian choices make it even more appealing. The standout item is the incredibly flavorful garlic bread, available at a great value. Additionally, the owner, Joe Vuskovich, is a local celebrity and community supporter, adding to the restaurant's charm.",
    "Pi has consistently delivered exceptional service and delicious pizzas on every visit. Despite a disappointing Ethiopian food experience earlier, we were quickly seated and treated with complimentary garlic bread. The deep-dish and thin crust pizzas were both amazing, and we devoured every bite.",
    "Great dental service for wisdom teeth extraction. However, inconsistent dentist rotation over the past 5 years.",
    "I heard about this place from a fellow Yelp Elite and decided to give it a try with my SO. We went on a Saturday morning and had to wait in line. \n\nThe takoyaki appetizer was delicious - perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. The fried octopus was good but didn't come with enough mayo. \n\nUnfortunately, the ramen noodles were overcooked and didn't fit well with the dishes. The broth was flavorful, but the red chili one was too spicy and covered up the depth. I preferred the black garlic broth. \n\nOverall, the food was tasty and reasonably priced. The decor was nice, but there were screaming kids running around which made our meal unpleasant.",
    "Without a doubt, this small cafe serves the best breakfast in Philly! Despite being a breakfast fanatic, I've explored all the renowned spots in town and this one stands out. The flavors here are simply incredible, and the dishes are both fresh and simple. Although the space is cozy, the menu is so fantastic that it could easily rival a larger establishment like Parc in terms of popularity.",
    "Incredible diner with great food and generous portions. Biscuits and gravy were outstanding. Highly recommended (6/5 stars)!",
    "This place is trendy and vibrant, but may not be suitable for older crowds. Despite the youthful and casual atmosphere, the food is worth trying and the staff handles the crowd well. I had a reservation and was seated before the appointed time. The crispy Brussel Sprouts were delicious and disguised the taste for those who dislike the vegetable. The pork schnitzel and fries were excellent, accompanied by a tasty whitish gravy. The service was attentive without being overbearing. The only downside was the crowded dining room and noise level, which prevents me from giving it a full 5-star rating. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and would give it 4 stars.",
    "The beers were amazing, especially the porter, double IPA, and table gutt. The food, particularly the Russian cuisine like the sausage and sauerkraut special and pickled everything appetizer, was killer. This place rules!",
    "Rickshaw in Reno offers some of the freshest fish for true sushi enthusiasts. With a focus on Nigiri and sashimi, their simplicity and quality stand out among the other sushi places in town. Skip the dressed-up rolls and sauces, and taste the pure fish at Rickshaw.",
    "My first visit here was not that impressive. The parking situation was bad, but they did have a good selection of draft beer. The food was okay, with the fried olives being a standout. However, the other appetizers like the blue cheese chips, calamari, and meat/cheese platter were just okay. I might give this place another chance, but overall, I wasn't thrilled.",
    "The restaurant's hype was unfounded. Average ambiance, limited menu, and unimpressive food. However, the location offers attractions if you choose to wait.",
    "This place exceeded my expectations! The ice cream was fantastic, especially the pumpkin cake and pralines and cream flavors. The brownie sundae was a masterpiece, with a perfect combination of brownie, ice cream, whipped cream, and nuts. The customer service was exceptional, with friendly and patient staff who even let me sample multiple flavors. I regret not trying their hot chocolate, but I had an amazing experience nevertheless. No judgment for devouring the brownie sundae by myself!",
    "Overall, the restaurant had a lackluster atmosphere upstairs, but the food was delicious. The Catfish Acadian was a standout dish, with a tasty and mysterious sauce accompanying it. The vegetables were also well cooked. However, the pork chop was underwhelming, so seafood might be a better choice. The waitress, Bria, was exceptional and made the visit enjoyable. While the reviewer is unsure about returning, they might give it another chance for dinner on the balcony as recommended.",
    "I had a disappointing experience at this restaurant. The service was poor, with a rude and neglectful waitress. The food was undercooked and the wings were small. There was also a feather found in one of the wings, which was unacceptable. The manager was not very helpful either. I suspect we were treated differently because we were a same-sex couple. The only positive aspect was that the meal was comped. I will not be returning. 1 out of 5 stars.",
    "This review criticizes the lack of a Target store and expresses frustration with the continued existence of a poorly updated K-Mart. The reviewer highlights their dissatisfaction with the store's customer service, including instances where sale prices were not honored and a price hike on a sought-after product. Overall, the review reflects a desire for a new Target store and disappointment with the current shopping experience at K-Mart.",
    "Surprisingly charming and delightful interior. Food is tasty and reasonably priced. Recommended dishes include the refreshing papaya salad, flavorful triple flavor duck, and the winning king tofu soup. Don't forget to bring your own booze!",
    "The Mazzoni Center provides incredibly comfortable and respectful services for individuals facing life challenges. However, the limited and exposed waiting room is a concern. Youth drop-in hours may have long wait times, but the staff advises on arrival times if called. There have been occasional communication lapses, but overall, the service is attentive. Leaving messages with reception ensures quick assistance, as doctors may not always be available over the phone.",
    "I would not recommend this BBQ place. The food was terrible - frozen pressed chicken, cartilage-filled ribs, bland sausage, and overly sweet sauce. It was also very overpriced for what seemed like a child's portion. Disappointing experience overall.",
    "I highly recommend this place for their great wine, delicious food, cozy ambiance, and excellent service.",
    "Terrible experience. Rude staff, incorrect salad order, and overpriced slices. Slow service even when we were the only customers. Save your money and go elsewhere.",
    "Authentic and delicious Mexican cuisine reminiscent of homemade meals. The enchiladas with mole sauce are incredible and the carne asada tacos take me back to Rosarito Beach. Highly recommended for a taste of California-approved Mexican food. Yummy!",
    "The Cinnamon Rolls from the bake house are a must-have! Two of them would bring immense happiness and light to your life. Additionally, their excellent coffee and salads make for a delightful Saturday morning breakfast treat.",
    "The carrot cake was a disappointment with a taste reminiscent of licorice and baking soda. It's a shame because the overall appearance was appealing, but the addition of chocolate chips did not complement the flavor either.",
    "The prices for unlimited food are unbeatable, but the overall experience falls short. While the sushi is delicious, the salad is mediocre and the crab Rangoon is disappointing. Nonetheless, I have visited twice and would still consider returning.",
    "Best chicken on Bourbon St! Delicious and flavorful, from the perfectly cooked meat to the tasty sauce. Everything is absolutely fantastic.",
    "The food at this place is amazing, especially the burger. Despite the high price of $16, it was worth every penny. The patty size is generous and the random ingredients like gruyere stuffed in a pepper make it unique. The fries were crispy and the bun was great. It's also a great spot for craft beer enthusiasts and can get crowded on weekends.",
    "I am disappointed with my recent breakfast experience at this place. The service was slow, coffee was not hot, and the grits were only warm. I had to wait twenty minutes for a cinnamon biscuit after my breakfast was already brought to the table. Even paying at the counter took an additional ten minutes. Overall, there are better breakfast options in the area. I regret not choosing my initial preference.",
    "Termini Brothers is simply the best! Their desserts are fantastic, especially the cannolis. As someone from an Italian family, we always have Termini Brothers dessert trays for our family events. Highly recommended!",
    "The hotel is nice with great service, awesome restaurants, and clean rooms.",
    "I had an amazing experience in New Orleans, which made me appreciate Reno even more! The shrimp po boy and corn bread at this place are simply delightful!",
    "Overall, the people here are friendly, but avoid going to Katie. She rushed through my hair, hastily applying color and cutting it without care. Despite the high price of nearly $200, the experience left me shaken up.",
    "This breakfast spot near Vandy is a must-visit in Nashville! Always busy, be sure to park in the back lot and grab a parking ticket for free parking. Their banana pancakes are absolute perfection - like banana bread in pancake form. Don't leave Nashville without trying them!",
    "MexiCali in University City offers multiple vegan options that are worth checking out. Their marinated tofu burrito is a personal favorite, boasting a chewy texture and protein-packed combination with black beans. The sweet potato and plantain burrito is also a great dairy-free choice, while the veggie tacos offer a spicier version with sweet potato, marinated tofu, and cabbage. For a delicious and filling option, their guacamole burrito with homemade guac is a must-try. Despite occasional lines, MexiCali has a well-established system to ensure quick service. I have been a loyal customer for years, even since their days as a lunch truck.",
    "The breakfast fare was great with delicious Eggs proven\u00e7ale, although slightly inconsistent in cooking. The tomato on the side was awesome. Omelets were well-executed and the pastries were impressive. However, the coffee was horrendously bad, which affected the overall breakfast experience. Additionally, the presence of misspellings on the menu makes it difficult to trust the restaurant, even if they are from another language.",
    "This restaurant is not your typical sports bar, as it is noisy and crowded with big screen TVs. However, it has a cool location and offers a good selection of beers. The food is delicious but leans more towards eclectic options, rather than traditional pub grub. This is a great spot if you're looking for a lively and flavorful experience with thumping music, but not suitable if you want to enjoy a burger, a beer, and watch a hockey game while engaging in sports conversations.",
    "Excellent service! Fast and hassle-free windshield repair. Didn't pay a dime. Highly recommend!",
    "This meal was absolutely outstanding! The service was top-notch and the food was some of the best in New Orleans. The oysters were a must-try, and the scallops with butternut squash pur\u00e9e and balsamic vinegar were divine. The dessert, cafe au lait panna cotta with mini glazed donuts, was the highlight of the meal. And their house made 'cellos, especially the ginger and limecellos, were unique and delicious. Overall, an amazing experience!",
    "BARRA was absolutely amazing! We went for Restaurant Week and were blown away by the delicious food and excellent service. The blood orange margaritas were strong and delicious. The veal and beef meatballs were melt-in-your-mouth and the grilled cheese appetizer was amazing. The fishermen stew was full of flavor and well balanced, while the steak with cauliflower puree and vegetable medley was juicy and tender. The service was top-notch, with a knowledgeable waiter who helped us with our order and checked on us frequently. BARRA is intimate, reasonably priced, and the perfect place for good food and great service.",
    "We had a great breakfast experience at this buzzing restaurant. Despite the long wait, the service was impressive. The cornmeal pancakes and banana pancakes were both delicious, although the portion of bacon was a bit small. The cornmeal pancakes were a perfect balance of flavors. The only disappointment was the coffee, which was surprising. The only dilemma is whether to choose the homemade syrup or the maple syrup, or maybe both.",
    "Poor customer service. Went on a Monday to enjoy a daiquiri and NBA game, but the young lady working preferred Netflix. Will not return.",
    "The Pearl exceeds all expectations with exceptional food, service, and ambiance. Every visit is a genuine dining experience that indulges and pampers. A must-try for anyone looking to treat themselves.",
    "Pretty good bagels with friendly staff, but unfortunately, poor hygiene practices observed. The guy handling transactions didn't wash his hands or wear gloves, which made me uncomfortable. He handled money, used the phone, and wiped his nose before making my bagel. I won't be returning, but if hygiene isn't a concern for you, the bagels are tasty.",
    "Tried someone new and had mixed results. Husband's cut looks great, but son's cut does not meet expectations.",
    "Overall, the steak was great, but the prices were on the higher side. The guacamole, although made in front of us, didn't impress and seemed to be prepared incorrectly.",
    "I absolutely love New Day Meadery! It never disappoints with its wide variety of meads and ciders. My usual go-to drinks are the South Cider and Shelby Blue Ribbon, but I recently tried the seasonal Paulding Light, which had a nice blend of cranberry, honey, and lime. Though not as sweet as the Shelby Blue Ribbon, it still tasted great. New Day Meadery always caters to different preferences, not just for sugar lovers like me. It's easily one of my favorite spots in Fountain Square, with friendly staff and prompt service.",
    "While better than the Philadelphia location, Szechuan House in Hamilton, NJ still remains the ultimate best.",
    "The food and service are exceptional. Fresh ingredients and flavorsome dishes make it a must-visit place. I'll definitely return.",
    "Had a disappointing experience at Make Up For Ever at KOP. Couldn't return opened products, had to exchange with additional cost. Still not impressed with the products, won't return. Will stick to Sephora for Make Up For Ever, better return policy.",
    "My favorite happy hour spot with amazing appetizers and great selection of beers. Superb food and cozy private party space available. Occasionally, there may be crashers wanting to use the ATM and restroom. Overall, just go and you won't be disappointed!",
    "I have experienced three instances where I ordered a green tea lemonade but received a peach tea lemonade instead. Each time, I had to return to the store, go inside, and request a remake.",
    "Overall, our experience at this newly opened restaurant was average. The pizza was decent, but nothing outstanding. The service was efficient, especially from the friendly pizza makers. However, the cashier lacked enthusiasm. While we wouldn't go out of our way to visit again, if we happen to be in the area and in the mood for pizza, we might consider returning.",
    "Overall, the dining experience at the restaurant was average. The hostess was friendly and the remodel looked impressive. However, there was a strong unpleasant odor upon entering. The menu was limited, but the food came out within a reasonable time. The \"Knuckle Sandwich\" was delicious, earning the two stars. On the other hand, the mushroom swiss burger was small and bland, while the chicken strips lacked seasoning. The fries were unremarkable. The server was nice, but difficult to hear in the loud dining room. Hopefully, the restaurant improves to achieve success.",
    "I had a delicious breakfast at Tuttini a few months ago, but my recent lunch experience was disappointing. Despite their sign stating lunch service until 2:30 PM, I was told that the kitchen was closing at 1:45 PM. The offer to make something to go contradicted their claim of being closed. Ultimately, I chose to eat elsewhere and spent my money at North Star Coffee instead.",
    "The service was quick and friendly, the portion size for the price was great, and the pancakes had the perfect consistency.",
    "I highly recommend this place! Fantastic food, friendly staff, and a peaceful atmosphere. The crepes are absolutely amazing, the best I've ever had. My friends also rave about this place.",
    "I have purchased tires from Tires Plus in Flourtown multiple times, including this visit where I had 4 new Michelins mounted. The service was prompt, starting right on time with my scheduled appointment at 9:00. My car was worked on and returned to me within just one hour.",
    "The Wildflower Triple brunch option at this place is amazing! With the ability to substitute any item, we had a tough time deciding. The food was delicious and the service was friendly. We might visit again during our stay.",
    "Great happy hour experience with amazing service from Vaughn and Mark. The free appetizer was awesome and the slot machines brought us luck. Must visit!",
    "The yogurt and crepes at this place are amazing! Highly recommend stopping by to try them.",
    "The event started late, overcrowded, and lacked variety. Most tents didn't offer wine, but rather advertisements, beer, or paid food. By 3 o'clock, most tables were empty. It was supposed to last till 5, but it was not worth the money. I probably won't return next year.",
    "Overall, I've had a great experience at this restaurant. The servers are dedicated and genuinely want to make your experience enjoyable. The seafood is decent, considering the limitations of getting fresh seafood in Tucson. The sauce they offer is similar to other popular seafood places, with an Asian twist. The price range is similar to other seafood restaurants, and while it may be expensive, it's not overpriced. I would recommend this place and would go back again.",
    "Food was fresh and well-prepared, but ravioli lacked filling, making them less flavorful. Service was great, but the place was too loud for a date night. Very small and crowded. Only worth returning for the BYOB policy.",
    "Yuengling Lager is a smooth, sweet and cheap beer that remains one of my top five favorites. I appreciate its low alcohol content and the fact that its taste varies per batch. The tour was enjoyable, with a funny British tour woman who took a liking to my grandpa. The facility had a nostalgic feel to it. The tasting was fantastic, although they were out of Lord Chesterfield. The fact that Yuengling rehired laid off workers after a closure adds to its appeal as a family business deserving of support.",
    "Review: Visited during Mardi Gras with friends. Despite the bustling atmosphere, most places were not overly crowded. However, the bartenders were disappointingly terrible - poor service and unappetizing pizza. \n\nPROS:\n- Convenient access to Port-O-Potty for a quick bathroom break\n- Outdoor seating available\n- Close proximity to the parade route\n\nCONS:\n- Bartenders lacked professionalism and attention to customers\n- Ignored patrons at the bar, even when it wasn't crowded\n- Lack of knowledge about microbrews and IPA beers, an unexpected downside",
    "Highly recommend this place for a clean and relaxing pedicure experience. Friendly staff and great ambiance.",
    "Short and concise review: \n\n\"Nice new burger spot downtown! Decent burgers, but ordering sides separately is a downside. They take reservations, which is convenient. Limited non-burger options. Lunch special would be a good addition. Great service and overall experience. Worth checking out!\"",
    "The salad was enjoyable, but unfortunately, the pizza was disappointing - boring, flavorless, and unsatisfying. I was very disappointed, especially considering this was my third visit. Additionally, the interior was cold on a chilly night. I won't be returning.",
    "Extremely disappointed. Sandwich bar closed, settled for a reheated burrito at an inflated price of $8. The taste was unpleasant with creamy chicken and old cheese toppings. Questionable how this can be considered edible. Taco Bell would have been a preferable choice.",
    "The brewpub has charming decor with plenty of games for children. The beer selection is good, although more adventurous options could be appreciated. The food can be hit or miss, with a gooey pizza and salty scotch egg variations. However, the burgers and desserts, especially the frangipane, are enjoyable. The ploughman's plate along with a beer provides a great opportunity for relaxation.",
    "Overall, I would give Zen Yai a 3.5 stars. The prices for their curry are great and the decor is appealing with vibrant colors. The service was good and the food was served promptly. However, my girlfriend was not satisfied with their green curry, which was a disappointment for her as a green curry enthusiast.",
    "I have stayed at this hotel multiple times and it remains my favorite. The staff is exceptional, from housekeeping to the front desk to valet service. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and the heating/AC is quiet. Special K goes above and beyond to make our visits wonderful. The turn-down service includes delicious Sucre chocolates. The bathroom was less slippery this time. Valet service is quick and efficient, with the option to text for your car. They also hosted a Gold Status reception. The only issue was a mini-bar charge which was quickly resolved. Overall, a great experience. Just a request to put Louis back in the elevator.",
    "Great rolls, excellent sake, and a unique experience in the bamboo room. Highly recommended for those who are able and agile.",
    "I absolutely love their food delivery service! The gyro was incredibly delicious and generously sized - I had to save half for later. The fries were unnecessary, as the gyro itself was filling. The tzaziki was perfect and the meat was tender. I will definitely be returning!",
    "I stopped by for takeout and a drink during happy hour. Tried the dragonberry iced tea, pleasantly refreshing. Enjoyed the lemongrass chicken and rice, but crab rangoon could have had more filling. Overall, consistent great food and service.",
    "Consistently outstanding quality and service. The #1 Deluxe is a delight. Big shout out to Amanda for going above and beyond with exceptional customer service.",
    "This hotel had the potential to be great with its charming location and unique rooms. Unfortunately, our stay was ruined by a bed bug infestation. Despite the management's efforts to resolve the issue, it was a gross and inconvenient experience. I ended up throwing away valuable belongings and am still concerned about bringing the bugs home. I would not recommend staying here unless significant measures are taken to ensure the elimination of bed bugs.",
    "We arrived promptly at 8:30 on a Saturday and were seated and served without any wait. The sweet potato pancakes with cinnamon cream syrup were delightful, but the hash browns were disappointing. The overall experience was underwhelming and not worth returning for, even without a wait. The bill came to $24.43 before tip. Sadly, the restroom lacked paper towels, suggesting a lack of attention to detail.",
    "This Marsh store is never crowded, making it easy to navigate and exit quickly. I do agree with another reviewer about the state of the red baskets, they need improvement. However, I appreciate the updated layout of the store and the convenient aisle setup. The only downside is that there always seems to be a shortage of cashiers. Nevertheless, Marsh offers a great selection of products as usual.",
    "This place offers creatively delicious food. The service is great, with coffee or tea served while waiting to be seated - a pleasant surprise. Their Bloody Marys are superb. A visit here is always an interesting and adventurous experience.",
    "The atmosphere is wonderful, offering a great selection of beers. The Asian chicken salads and Cajun pasta were both excellent. Definitely coming back again.",
    "I have been a fan of this place for almost 25 years and continue to love it. It started as a Delaware treat, but I'm glad it's expanding to more locations. I hope they come to the Huntsville AL area soon. Although this review is not about this specific location, if it's as good as others I've been to, it will be great! The seating was plentiful, the place was clean, and they were playing good music while I waited. The only downside is that they don't have Herrs chips like the Delaware locations, but that's not a big problem.",
    "The prices initially seemed reasonable, but I soon realized they charge extra for every add-on. Unfortunately, the food is subpar, with hard and dry rice and sad, limp burritos. The waitress had a terrible attitude on both my visits. The saving grace is their guacamole and strong margaritas. It seems their tactic is to intoxicate customers into not minding the mediocre food and rude service.",
    "My boyfriend and I ventured out of our usual restaurants in Trolley Square and stumbled upon this adorable Italian gem. The waiter was incredibly warm and gave us great recommendations. The food was outstanding, with freshly made dishes and a delicious bread recipe straight from Sicily. We loved the prosciutto wrapped Shrimp and both our pasta dishes were excellent. Portions were generous, leaving leftovers for my lunch the next day. And the cannoli? Unbelievably good, according to my boyfriend, who has been to Italy. If you're craving a delicious Italian meal at a reasonable price, don't miss out on this place. We lucked out with a special of a free appetizer when ordering two entrees. Definitely worth checking out!",
    "This restaurant deserves a 3.5-star rating due to the absence of alcohol, which was disappointing after a long week. Nevertheless, the margherita pie was delicious and fresh. We also enjoyed the appetizing Greek salad, brimming with tasty veggies. Yum!",
    "I love Mr. Wizard's for their healthier frozen yogurt option compared to frozen custard. The option to choose pre-select combinations or create your own is great. However, limited outdoor seating can be inconvenient in cold weather, so eating in your car might be necessary.",
    "The restaurant's name and logo may not hold much meaning, unless it represents three individuals pooling their resources to start the business. Regardless, the food was excellent, the staff was friendly, and they offer an extensive menu ranging from breakfast to dessert. The fact that it is open 24 hours makes it a definite go-to spot next time I'm in town.",
    "Had a fabulous night at Spasso with friends. Our meals were incredible, especially the seafood special. Leftovers were delicious too. Service was fantastic, and the wine selection was spot on. Can't wait to return!",
    "I had a terrible experience at this nail salon. Initially, the owner was friendly and attentive. However, when I refused to pay their exorbitant price for a pedicure, she completely ignored me and showed no regard for my business. She even reassigned my nail tech without explanation. I observed her catering to new customers while disregarding my presence. This salon has horrible customer service, and not everyone wants to spend a fortune on nail services, regardless of its self-proclaimed \"high-end\" status.",
    "The ice cream was mediocre but satisfied my sweet craving while passing through Belmawr. The service was friendly but a bit slow. The charming decor adds to the ambience. I might return if I lived nearby, but wouldn't make a special trip for it.",
    "Devlin's is the best auto body shop in Philadelphia. My Honda Fit was in rough shape with nicks, dents, scratches, and lime stains. After being touched up, the car looked brand new. Ed Devlin is a miracle worker, providing exceptional results at a surprisingly affordable price.",
    "45 may not have any standout features, but it has a cozy \"Cheers\" atmosphere where everyone knows your name, even if you can barely see their face through the cigarette smoke. The smoke never bothers me, but it turns off some of my friends. The laid-back and divey vibe is what draws me here, and the spread of food during game days is a nice touch rarely seen in bars now. Baseball season is dominated by Red Sox fans, so keep your allegiances quiet. Don't forget about the food truck parked outside, a delicious treat. If you're going to Tipitinas for a show, 45 is a great pre or post-show stop.",
    "The coffee at this place is excellent, but having to ask separately for cream and sugar can feel pretentious and intimidating. Coffee should be served to our preferences without making it a big deal.",
    "The grits at this brunch spot are my favorite and I can't resist ordering them every time. The portion size is huge and you can add toppings for a small fee. The grits are perfectly cooked and not at all grainy or watery. I can't recommend them enough!",
    "The staff is amazing, and everything is consistently good. The chili cheese etoufee is fantastic. Only deducted a star because it's cash only. However, the option to sit outside on a pleasant evening is a nice touch. Don't miss out on the garlic sauce!",
    "The outside tables offer a pleasant view, although the food and service are standard for a beach setting. However, it's a great spot to enjoy a drink while soaking in the scenery.",
    "I couldn't be happier with my experience at All About Hair. Lou not only gave me an amazing haircut but also created a welcoming atmosphere and engaging conversation. I am so impressed that I am considering contacting Yelp! to suggest expanding their star rating system for this exceptional place. Lou is now my go-to barber, and All About Hair has gained a loyal customer in me. 5 stars all the way!",
    "Overall, the trip was still enjoyable for my kids despite the poor quality of the derma bond used, resulting in a scar on my buddy. Unfortunately, the scar is in a bad spot and since my buddy is not yet two and constantly moving, it was difficult to manage. I believe it's fair to expect better.",
    "This hotel offers exceptional airport views and the exclusive feature of a revolving rooftop restaurant. Connected to the airport, it provides easy access to various dining and shopping options. The highlight is the panoramic view from the rooftop restaurant, encompassing the runways and control tower.",
    "Fantastic food and atmosphere! The turkey, beans, and biscuits are heavenly. The pecan pie was good, but I've had better. Still, I can't wait to return!",
    "I had a great experience at this family style restaurant and bar. The menu was extensive, the restaurant and restrooms were clean, and the staff was friendly. Despite being busy during our visit, the service was prompt and efficient. Although I can't give them a perfect rating since I only had a sandwich, I enjoyed my meal. They had a good selection of draft beers and also served wine and mixed drinks. I loved the thoughtful touch of providing crayons and a large sheet of paper for kids to draw on. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.",
    "The food was great, especially the crab cocktail. My husband enjoyed his steamers. The only downside was the high humidity in the restaurant. A fan would have been a nice addition.",
    "Freddy's offers the best fast-food style burgers with great toppings and fresh meat. Their fries paired with the \"fry\" sauce are delicious. Additionally, their custard is rich, creamy, and absolutely delicious.",
    "This place is a must-visit for donut lovers! The donuts were excellent, reasonably priced, and incredibly soft. We couldn't resist trying the blueberry cake donut and apple fritter, both were absolutely delicious. We'll definitely be returning for more!",
    "I had a wonderful experience at the Nashville location and was excited to learn that there was now one in New Orleans. However, our visit to the New Orleans location was disappointing. We arrived at 10pm and waited for 10 minutes without being greeted. When we went to the bar for assistance, we were informed that the kitchen was behind on orders. After waiting for 25 minutes with no service or apology, we decided to leave. This was not the experience I expected from such a well-known establishment. I hope this is not indicative of their usual service.",
    "Allegro's offers deliciously affordable and speedy pizza, with the sicilian and meaty options being exceptionally tasty. The stuffed varieties are also worth a try, although some centers may be cold. While they sell beer, I cannot comment on it due to my age during my time in Philadelphia. However, the service can be occasionally rude, and the presence of individuals talking to themselves can be off-putting.",
    "The Peppermill in Reno is a fantastic casino with excellent service, clean rooms, and great amenities. The staff is friendly, and the casino has the loosest slots in town. The happy hour at the Fireside Lounge is a great deal, and the Fish Bar with its aquarium is a relaxing place to unwind. The only downside is that the bright lights in the casino can be disorienting, so keep the map they give you handy. Overall, a highly recommended place to stay in Reno.",
    "Two thumbs up! The burger was excellent, pulled pork was very good, and my wife loved her egg white and goat cheese omelette. The beer list is solid and the spicy bloody Mary hit the spot. Great service and an eclectic playlist added to the overall experience.",
    "I had a negative experience at Peppermill due to their poor treatment and lack of response after I intervened to help during an incident. Despite restraining the assailant and calling for security, I was asked to leave or be considered trespassing. They did not address the situation or show any gratitude for my assistance. As a result, I have no intention of returning to Peppermill.",
    "I attended a conference at this 5 mile wide/long convention center with 2,000 guestrooms and 6,000 attendees. Despite booking late, I didn't want to spend $200+/night on a hotel room, so I stayed at a budget hotel across the street. The convention center itself is massive and well-staffed, with excellent shuttle service and lunch/drinks. However, the food inside is overpriced. The surrounding area has popular chain restaurants. Overall, the convention center is immaculate, but on a student budget, I opted for a cheaper hotel.",
    "Unfortunately, the restaurant no longer offers BBQ sauce as a base for their pizzas, which greatly disappointed me and the children. Despite explaining that we have enjoyed this customization in the past, the staff declined our request and even denied the possibility of paying extra for it. As a result, we had to leave and find an alternative dining option. Sadly, I won't be able to bring the kids to this restaurant again.",
    "This hidden gem is absolutely adorable! The staff is incredibly friendly and the cookie dough is to die for. We stumbled upon this place by chance and couldn't be happier. A definite must-visit!",
    "Taco Review: Mediocre chips and salsa, average tacos.",
    "I'm thrilled this place is in Reno! The matcha and ube flavors are delicious and authentic. The staff is friendly and although they have room for improvement, their base is solid. The soft serve, cake, and sauces are perfectly balanced, not overly sweet. Can't wait for more flavors to be added!",
    "I stumbled upon this small, pleasant restaurant closer to my home and I am so glad I did. The menu may be small, but the food packs a punch. The Duck Fries were heavenly, with smoked gouda, shredded duck, and scallions. The large portion for just $8 was impossible to resist picking at. I tried the scallop and foie gras tacos, which were amazing despite my reservations about the origin of foie gras. The pork roll burger that my companion ordered was incredibly juicy and perfectly cooked. I will definitely be a returning customer.",
    "Three Muses in New Orleans offers delectable tapas-style dishes meant for sharing. While the fish tacos were underwhelming, the lamb sliders and steak and cake were absolutely phenomenal. The lamb paired with goat cheese was exquisite, and the crab cake was the best I've ever had.",
    "Great ambiance and trendy decor. Presentation of dishes was impressive. However, the food was just okay, with undercooked potatoes and greasy pancakes. Will definitely return to try the enticing french toast and omelette. Also interested in exploring their lunch menu. Excellent service.",
    "This place is amazing! The food is delicious, and the service is incredibly friendly. The homemade flan is exceptional, and the price is just right. It would be perfect if they had a liquor license.",
    "Had a delightful breakfast with family after a swift stopover. The food was fantastic, and the service, thanks to Jonathan, was impeccable. A hidden gem with a bustling atmosphere but no Saturday wait.",
    "The Praline Connection provided Dad with a heavenly Southern food experience, surpassing Willie Maes. His soul platter's fried chicken was the best he's ever had, and the red beans and rice evoked childhood memories. Mom enjoyed her meatloaf with cabbage and lima beans, while my ribs were a bit tough. The potato salad was good, but the mac and cheese lacked flavor. However, the cornbread was fantastic. Next time, I'm definitely trying the fried chicken!",
    "I highly recommend Buddy Brew in Tampa. Their flavorful coffee and beautiful latte art are a treat. The modern design reminds me of New York's coffee shops. Free parking is a definite advantage, but limited seating and uncomfortably cold temperatures may encourage taking your coffee to go and exploring Hyde Park Village instead.",
    "V Vegaz Salon in the East Loop is an underrated gem with a spacious and modern interior. The stylists are happy and the vibe is great. Callie is my go-to stylist who always understands my hair and gives me a great cut. The compliments I receive even a month after my haircut speak volumes about her skills. Highly recommended for those looking for a salon with an edge.",
    "The lady who works here is a miracle worker! I brought in pants and a suit jacket that needed hemming and sleeve shortening, respectively. Despite the complexity and urgency, she completed the alterations in a day, delivering excellent, professional results. The suit now fits me perfectly for my business trip. They accept all major credit cards and have convenient hours. Will definitely come back.",
    "The Irish Pol: Great beer selection and lively atmosphere on Saturday nights, but disappointing happy hour experience. Dark and dingy interior with an older crowd. Will return for weekend fun, but not for happy hour.",
    "This place has the best spaghetti & meatballs I've ever had. Cozy atmosphere, now my favorite Italian spot.",
    "I had a fantastic Happy Hour experience at this place! The 50 cent oysters and half price drinks were a great deal. The beet salad, mussels, and flammenkuchen were all excellent. The flammenkuchen had caramelized onions, cheese, and bacon - it was even better than what I had tried in Strasbourg. Highly recommend!",
    "I have dined at this place three times and each experience has been enjoyable for both me and the kids. There is no smoke or noise, and the food and service are consistently good. Perhaps the late Tuesday afternoon timing has contributed to our positive experiences. I have tried different dishes each time and have always been satisfied and happy with my choices. I will definitely return to dine here again.",
    "Excellent pizza! Beautiful ambiance and inviting atmosphere. Friendly and efficient service.",
    "Richard's in downtown is a gem. From the fresh Caesar salad and bread to the mouthwatering cheese ravioli with pesto cream sauce, every dish was perfection. The pesto sauce was well-balanced, allowing the delicate pasta to shine. To top it off, the Dunham cabernet was delightful. Welcome to downtown, Richard's!",
    "I had a great breakfast experience at this place last weekend. The French toast with a side of fruit and a la carte fried egg was delicious. The staff accidentally dropped my egg, but they quickly replaced it. The vanilla latte was excellent, not needing any additional sweeteners. The patio seating was lovely, and even indoor seating provided a nice atmosphere with fresh breezes flowing through the open doors and windows. Overall, a really nice experience.",
    "Despite the food being only decent, the inviting atmosphere and friendly staff make this place worth coming back to. The fresh fruit and great coffee were highlights of the experience.",
    "We loved Salty's! Great kids menu with a variety of options. Crabby Dip was delicious but a bit pricey. Salty Burger and macadamia crusted grouper were fantastic. Amazing service, definitely a five-star experience!",
    "Unfortunately, our recent experience with the chili beef nachos and chicken burrito was not pleasant, as both my boyfriend and I experienced stomach issues. Although we appreciate the shredded beef at this establishment and usually enjoy it, this time we were disappointed with the freshness of the ingredients.",
    "This place is amazing, reminiscent of the past. The music is fantastic. However, I deducted one star as seating is limited to the first 15 people in line.",
    "I highly recommend choosing Blue Fin or Masamoto instead.",
    "The BW Pepper Tree Inn was a decently priced option for our bachelorette party in Santa Barbara. The rooms were clean and cozy, with charming exterior and grounds. The beds were relatively comfortable, and we appreciated the bath and body works amenities, as well as the free water bottles and fruit in the room. However, the decor was dated, there were some toilet issues, the door was difficult to open, and there was no hair dryer or complimentary breakfast. Despite these drawbacks, considering the location and price range, I still wouldn't have chosen to stay anywhere else in Santa Barbara, making it a good choice for our group.",
    "The recent barbecued pulled pork burger at Johnny Rockets was a delicious and filling meal. The flavor was fantastic and the endless fries were a bonus. However, it's unfortunate that they no longer have the singing and dancing at this location since they moved. Overall, I've never had a bad experience here.",
    "I would not recommend this salon. It is unclean, with cobwebs, dust, and outdated equipment. The nail technician's distraction with YouTube during my service was unacceptable. The lack of health department intervention surprises me.",
    "5/5 \u2b50\ufe0f\n\nI highly recommend this local business! They offer a wide variety of products and best of all, complimentary popcorn. Why spend money at corporate giants when you can enjoy free popcorn here? Truly a great experience!",
    "I love this place! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the space is roomy with plenty of outlets, and the tea is delicious. The taro bubble tea is a must-try, but be prepared for the suspense of not knowing when a pearl will enter your mouth. The only downside is the music, which can be distracting, but bringing headphones solves the problem.",
    "Yah Man is an absolute must-visit in Tampa! The atmosphere, personal service, and delicious Caribbean fare will not disappoint. The beef pie, chicken, and island sampler plates were all mouthwatering, while the bread pudding was simply divine. We left completely satisfied and in high spirits. Whether you're a local or a visitor, this place is a gem. Friendly staff too! Highly recommended, had to share on Yelp for the third time because it's that good!",
    "This chill backyard bar is my favorite spot in New Orleans. The local music options are amazing, but make sure to go with a smaller group as seating can be tight. The wine and cheese bar up front is perfect for grabbing a delicious tray of cheeses and accoutrements. Their wine selection is excellent and reasonably priced. It's a great place to escape the tourist crowds and have an unforgettable night in New Orleans.",
    "Fantastic lunch experience! The chicken Caesar was delicious and my companion loved their custom salad. The waitress was friendly and gave us ample time to enjoy our meal without feeling rushed. The restaurant's hidden location added to the charming ambiance. Highly recommend!",
    "I made a reservation more than a week in advance with a request to be near the band, but upon arrival, they had no record of it. Unfortunately, we ended up stuck in the back next to the bathroom. The cocktails, food, band, and atmosphere were fantastic, deserving 5 stars. However, the utter lack of organization and the fact that they gave open tables near the front to people with reservations left us completely disappointed. The woman who took our reservation claimed to be new, so I guess it's always better to call and confirm. This experience was particularly disappointing since we've had amazing experiences at this place before.",
    "Highly recommend this professional tattoo shop! Bryan's outstanding work left my husband and I extremely happy with our new ink. The entire team is super nice, and it's no surprise they are the city's top tattoo shop. Remember, their new location is at 1418 N. Clairborne, Suite 5, upstairs.",
    "This place has the best view in Santa Barbara and awesome wines. The owners, Tom and Gillian, are always generous hosts and treat us well. The Conway cabs are the best in town and we were gifted a fantastic bottle of Conway 13 reserve Syrah. The Rolos red is a favorite for wine snobs and newcomers alike. Even our 5-year-old son loves going here and we are never disappointed.",
    "This draft latte is exceptionally good. 10/10. Plus, the guy at the register complimented my tie.",
    "Absolutely amazing food! Must-try BBQ shrimp and the truffle fries are a hit. Truffle butter filet mignon is a must for truffle lovers. Don't miss the delicious bread pudding and white chocolate brownie for dessert.",
    "I highly recommend this wine and cheese shop! The unique atmosphere allows you to select your own bottle of wine and choose from an array of cheeses and meats. The staff then creates a beautiful cheese board with extras like nuts, spreads, and sliced artisan bread. It's like magic! We were so satisfied with the platter and wine that we didn't need to order from the kitchen.",
    "Absolutely loved my dining experience at Smiley's! Smiley is an amazing host and the food was simply delicious. I enjoyed it so much that I'm having it for lunch again today and I can't wait. I highly recommend this place to everyone in Manayunk, it's a gem that shouldn't be missed!",
    "Steakhouse X offers above average steaks with outstanding service and an excellent wine list, comparable to renowned restaurants like Ocean Prime and Ruth's Chris.",
    "I had dinner here with a friend on Sunday. The seating arrangement surprised me - we were seated next to another party with a small partition separating us. The restaurant is small and can get noisy. However, the service was great. The food was decent - we ordered the Kale Caesar and the Fried Chicken with Mac n Cheese. Unfortunately, they were out of watermelon so the accompanying salad had to be substituted. The Kale Caesar had a delicious soft egg with a crispy crust and runny yolk, which impressed me.",
    "I was disappointed with the service and beer selection at this brewery. Despite finding our own table, the wait staff completely ignored us. The wait for our flight of beers was lengthy and the quality was underwhelming. In fact, one even tasted like soap. I've had much better experiences and tastings at other breweries.",
    "I've been here twice for breakfast and the experience was really awkward. The staff on Saturday mornings seemed inexperienced and were often cursing and yelling at each other. The ordering system is confusing as they sometimes come to your table, but it seems random. The coffee and drinks are self-serve and not good. The lack of shades at the front window can make it uncomfortable. The food was okay, but my pulled pork wrap had a lot of gristle. The cornbread pancakes were tasty though. The payment process is inconvenient as you pay afterwards. I regret bringing my brother here for brunch, it's a dive. Don't expect traditional breakfast service or a nice atmosphere. It's cheap, but you get what you pay for.",
    "Great classic Greek diner. The Greek omelette with feta, gyro meat, tomato, and spinach was fantastic. Loved the classic griddle home fries and the service was outstanding. We'll definitely be coming back when we're in the area.",
    "Unfortunately, the experience at this restaurant fell short of expectations. Despite waiting for over half an hour, only miso soup and drinks were served. Disappointingly, the actual food ordered was nowhere to be seen, leaving us waiting and still hungry.",
    "The doctor was great - friendly, attentive, professional and funny!",
    "While the Ramen at this place may not be the best, their Steven roll was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend asking for roll recommendations if you visit. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Philly.",
    "Unless you fit a certain demographic, expect subpar service. Our waitress was more interested in socializing with older, wealthier patrons and neglected to check on us or our meals. Disappointed with the lack of attention despite the high cost.",
    "The Paris Hair Salon is an exceptional place with skilled professionals who genuinely understand hair. They provide a warm and welcoming atmosphere, taking the time to effectively handle even the most difficult hair types. I am extremely satisfied with their services, as they consistently deliver perfect results for cuts, colors, and highlights. Moreover, their prices are reasonable. Highly recommended! - Maureen Kerfoot",
    "I was thrilled to have a Chick-Fil-A nearby, but the incompetence at the drive-thru and peculiar layout left me disappointed. However, I appreciate the free WiFi while enduring the long wait. I'll stick to the locations in Rivergate or Cool Springs for top-notch waffle fries.",
    "I highly recommend this place! Great service, convenient payment system, and fresh, delicious food. The chicken taco salad and plantains were excellent. The drinks, especially the mojito, were tasty as well. Can't wait to come back and explore more of their menu.",
    "I had a fantastic experience with the Sultans of Schlep for a small move in the city. Tom was attentive and responsive, while the movers were punctual and efficient. Reasonable prices and complimentary wardrobe boxes were a bonus. Plus, their cool and funny name adds to their appeal. I would gladly work with them again!",
    "I recently had a pedicure at this place and it was amazing. The cleanliness and ambiance were impressive, and there was no wait time. They definitely know what they are doing.",
    "Yats is hands down the best Cajun food we've ever had. Not only is it delicious, but it's also affordable. The menu is always a pleasant surprise, with an eclectic variety of dishes displayed on a chalkboard. It has become a regular spot for my wife and me to enjoy delightful culinary surprises.",
    "The pizza place had an impressive selection and my roast beef sandwich was delicious, although it took a bit longer to prepare. Limited seating inside, but a community patio is available. Excited to try their highly recommended pizza.",
    "We had a great experience at this location on July 4th. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially the compassionate nurse who tried to remove my daughter's ear wax. Despite multiple attempts, he couldn't get it out, but the doctor quickly resolved the issue. We received prescriptions and found them cheaper at the Target in the same shopping center. Overall, it was a convenient and efficient place for immediate care while on vacation. Thank you!",
    "The veggie wings at this place are hands down the best I've ever had. I can't stop thinking about them. The fried pickles are also great, but the drinks are a bit weak. Stick to the Mexican coke when you're here.",
    "The diner has a pleasant and cozy atmosphere, stands out from others. Tried the Yankee pot roast - average taste and bland meat, but veggies were fantastic. My wife enjoyed her omelette. Service was outstanding.",
    "The Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Bento Box was a disappointment as it arrived without rice, which is an essential component of a bento box. Zero stars.",
    "Brooke's music isn't up to par anymore. A significant change from pop edm is necessary.",
    "Great price, excellent location, and comfortable accommodations with spacious rooms. However, the bed is quite firm and the sheets are rough. Despite this, I'd definitely consider staying here again!",
    "The food was great and the service was impressive, especially considering how busy the place was.",
    "Had an amazing first-time experience here! The food was fantastic, but the highlight is the stunning beach view and soothing sounds of crashing waves. They also sell beer, which is a bonus. Highly recommended, even if it's not in the area, it's worth the drive. Will definitely return!",
    "Attended a party at this venue and was impressed by their private room with a dedicated bar and bathroom. The buffet was enjoyable, the service efficient, and the atmosphere allowed for clear conversations. Highly recommended for hosting an event!",
    "I had a fantastic experience at LF for my first visit. Tori was amazing and turned my desired hairstyle into reality. She also provided helpful suggestions for my fine and thin hair type. The salon was clean, modern, and parking was easy. Overall, it was a great experience!",
    "I highly recommend this place! The burger had amazing flavor, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The sides were generous and delicious, especially the homemade potato chips and waffle fries sweet potatoes. The outside patio was lovely, although I wish there was a no-smoking policy. Our waiter, Jesse, provided excellent service. Overall, this hidden gem is definitely worth a visit and I will be coming back.",
    "Mark at Blades is fantastic! I've been a client for over 2 years now after trying out other salons like Dominic Michael. With Mark's salon experience and his affordable prices, I always leave Blades loving my haircut. Highly recommend!",
    "Overall, this restaurant has a modern decor and is perfect for people in their 20s. I highly recommend the mahi mahi with pita chips and hummus - it was delicious with tender and flavorful fish. The service was also commendable.",
    "I absolutely love this place for dim sum! The menu could be expanded, but the quality is amazing. Best dim sum in Reno, hands down. We prefer ordering in advance and dining in. The chicken feet and siu mai are our favorites here. Their combo meal with sesame chicken and fried rice is delicious, and my husband enjoys the beef and broccoli or shrimp and vegetables. The combo also includes a tasty appetizer and/or cup of hot soup. Highly recommend, unless you're willing to travel to Sacramento.",
    "I had an excellent lunch experience with my group of eight hungry people. Despite expecting a crowd, we didn't have to wait and the parking lot was empty. The server was amazing, although I can't remember her name. The cheeseburger and fries were cooked to perfection, and we all had a great time without any complaints.",
    "Hands down, the bayou burger is the ultimate burger experience. The staff is fantastic too, earning a resounding thumbs up.",
    "I highly recommend this corporate event venue for its flawless service, creative and tasty hors d'oeuvres, delicious lobster consomm\u00e9, perfectly cooked and seasoned filet, generous portion sizes, and stunning view. The private dining room has a better view than the main dining room and the service was never intrusive. I would definitely consider returning for a special occasion dinner. Overall, a fantastic experience.",
    "Lazos serves the best pizza in the Fairmount/Art Museum/Brewerytown area. The pepperoni and wings were delicious, with a delightful crispy texture. Surprisingly, the wings were not soggy like many others. Although they mistakenly gave me Sprite instead of Coke, the overall pizza and wing combo was excellent. Will definitely order from Lazos again!",
    "I recently enjoyed an express lunch at this charming restaurant with old school decor featuring dark woods and a copper tile ceiling. The deal included a choice of soup with the entree of the day, and I must say, the gumbo and crab bisque were fantastic. The gumbo had a rich flavor with a touch of heat from the andouille sausage, while the crab bisque was perfectly seasoned with old bay style seasoning and had just the right amount of shredded crab. The entree, garganelli with roast pork ragu, mushrooms, and creole tomatoes, was a delightful blend of flavors with a light sauce that highlighted the dish. The roast pork itself was tender, caramelized, and left me craving more. Overall, a satisfying lunch experience in a visually appealing setting.",
    "The hotel was excellent with friendly staff, ideal location near popular attractions like Bourbon Street and Harra's, and just a short walk to Jackson Square. The only drawback was the pricey $38 per night parking.",
    "I had a great experience at this store yesterday. The selection was impressive, especially the Chloe and Marc Jacobs items and the Chanel pumps, although they were too small for me. The price range is excellent, and the current summer sales are a bonus. I appreciate the value for money and the fact that they offer higher-end items, such as silky blouses, which I am willing to pay $100 for. The staff member was also extremely friendly and nice. This store will definitely be my go-to from now on.",
    "The service was extremely disappointing, with unhelpful staff and poor communication. Despite winning a happy hour, the organizer was unresponsive and forgot about my reservation. The bouncers and bartenders were not friendly or efficient, and the crowd was unappealing. While the free drinks were a bonus, I would not recommend this place for any other reason.",
    "My first impression of this 7 Eleven was positive due to its clean and spacious appearance. However, I had a negative experience when the cashier initially tried to charge me more for plastic cups, but I quickly resolved the issue and got them for a lower price. The unscrupulous part was when the cashier and manager attempted to deceive me by claiming a higher price.",
    "Terrible nail salon experience. Insulting staff, poor service, and rushed job. Clearly, they haven't learned from previous negative reviews.",
    "The gelati provided by this place is absolutely amazing and perfect for cooling down on scorching hot days. Despite the calories and diabetes concerns, it is totally worth it. Five stars for their fantastic frozen treats. PS: Don't forget to check out their website for some Vanilla Ice!",
    "The all-you-can-drink brunch at this place is a must-try! For just $20, you get delicious brunch items and unlimited bloody marys or mimosas. Perfect for a fun Sunday outing. Enjoy!",
    "This Chinese restaurant offers good food and a great beer selection. I haven't tried their sushi, so I can't comment on that. The staff is not overly friendly, but they are satisfactory for takeout service. Keep in mind that it's not a high-end establishment, so set realistic expectations.",
    "Andres Richard Salon on Locust St is the place to go for exceptional hair care. Stephanie, a junior stylist at the salon, worked her magic and transformed my hair exactly as I wanted after a disappointing experience at other salons. I highly recommend their technical, creative, and expert services. This is now the only salon I trust with my hair.",
    "I like the festive atmosphere and wide selection of Spanish music. The attentive service and ability to accommodate picky orders is a plus. The salad could be improved with better lettuce. The chicken soup is highly recommended and the friend who ordered it is a culinary expert. The queso fundido is also a must-try, but be cautious with adding chorizo to avoid greasiness.",
    "Extremely disappointed with the service and quality of tea latte at this Starbucks. Despite waiting 15 minutes with four people working, the drink turned out watery. Even after returning it twice, the offered replacement was no better. The baristas need to improve their skills. Disappointing experience overall.",
    "Highly recommended! Thin, crispy crust and excellent customer service. This place has the best pizza in town. A must-visit if you're a pizza lover.",
    "I highly recommend this place, it might even be better than Halal Guys. Despite arriving close to closing time, the friendly staff, especially Jules, made me feel welcome and helped me navigate the menu. I ordered the steak shwarma with rice and all the sauces, and it was absolutely delicious! The food had a healthy quality to it and left me feeling satisfied. I will definitely be returning here.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, with just the right level of tranquility. The staff struck a perfect balance between casual conversation and attentiveness. Despite its size, the restaurant felt spacious. The friendly and accommodating staff made the experience even better. As for the food, it was delicious. I highly recommend trying the Crabby Wife with fried eggs and the chicken & waffles with hot-sauce, syrup, and their special sauce \u2013 simply fantastic! Overall, it was an excellent experience.",
    "Surrey's is a hidden gem outside the city center that is worth a visit for brunch. The shrimp n grits are the best in town and the freshly squeezed juices are a refreshing choice. Even non-omelette lovers will be converted by the delicious lump crab omelette with sauce. Just be prepared for crowds and arrive early to avoid hunger pangs while waiting for a table.",
    "I liked the store's large and clean space with a good selection of items. However, the customer service was lacking during my recent visit. Despite asking for permission to try clothes on my French Bulldog, no assistance was provided. Furthermore, when a cat in the store swatted my dog, no one came to help. Overall, I left disappointed and don't plan on returning due to the poor service.",
    "Outstanding service! The team at this shop is knowledgeable, honest, and communicates effectively. They took care of our older cars with meticulous attention to detail. I highly recommend them for all your service needs.",
    "This place was great - clean, bright, and had plenty of options for frozen yogurt and toppings. The friendly cashier even allowed me to pay with my credit card, even though I was a bit short on cash. My son had a blast here!",
    "Stopped by for Sunday brunch a couple of weeks ago. The food was delicious and satisfying, with great drink options. Our server was pleasant, and we loved the cool cafe atmosphere. Definitely recommend it.",
    "First visit tonight. Nice, clean and reasonably priced place with friendly staff. Unfortunately, the food was extremely bland and mediocre. The chicken fajitas had a tepid base and room temperature meat. Pico, cheese, sour cream and tortillas were nothing special. Overall, underwhelming experience. Unlikely to return.",
    "Gelateria is my go-to spot in St. Louis for the most satisfying gelato experience. The coffee house-like atmosphere, complemented by a spacious outdoor patio adorned with a fountain and lush greenery, creates the perfect backdrop for indulging in their delectable gelato and delicious baked goods. Everything about this place is simply delightful.",
    "I highly recommend this small sushi gem near Dale Mabry. The bar seating offers entertaining interactions with friendly sushi chefs. Although the sticky rice could be stickier, the sushi was incredibly fresh and flavorful. The standout was definitely the Wahoo, a must-try! With a reasonable price of $30 for dinner, I can't wait to return for more.",
    "Food - Cheap and large selection. \nService - Poor. They forgot our order, no apology, and 15 minutes of waiting. Disappointing customer service.",
    "Larry's Steaks near St. Joe's University is a suitable replacement for the once great Dallesandro's. Their cheesesteak, similar to the original, is sliced and minced perfectly with melted cheese throughout. The onions and mushrooms are also top-notch. It's greasy, but not excessively so. Skip Pat's and Geno's and give Larry's a try for a real Philly cheesesteak experience.",
    "This place is extremely disappointing. The service was horrendous and the food arrived cold, resulting in a hassle to send it back. Unless there's a significant improvement in management and staff expectations, I advise staying away from this place.",
    "I visited this place a year ago before the e.coli / colliform scare. Due to concerns for my health and safety, I haven't returned since. It's unfortunate because I genuinely enjoyed this place. However, I still have doubts about their ability to maintain proper food safety standards. My suggestion is for them to cook their meat thoroughly at 165\u00b0F to kill any bacteria, serve the food at a high temperature to ensure bacteria are eliminated, and only use greens and veggies sourced from the USA to avoid water pollution cross-contamination issues in Mexico.",
    "I ordered a variety of items with specific customization, but unfortunately, I received incorrect and mixed-up orders. The employee seemed confused when I requested no ketchup. This is a basic task that should have been easily executed.",
    "I tried this place for breakfast upon a friend's recommendation and it didn't disappoint! Despite the busy Saturday morning, we were seated promptly and the service was friendly and speedy. The veggie omelette with fruit and rye toast was delicious, and there were plenty of options for all preferences. The prices were reasonable considering the generous portions. I'll definitely be returning!",
    "Wells Fargo provides an enjoyable atmosphere for all ages, consistently delivering excellent game experiences regardless of seating location. I highly recommend attending a Flyers game, even for those who aren't typically fans of hockey.",
    "Great place for late-night eats with a must-have drive-through. Offers new menu items and veggie options, but unfortunately forgot to include my dessert order in the bag. Very disappointing.",
    "The spinach and feta hummus is simply amazing, and the chicken caesar pita was equally wonderful. The flavorful caesar dressing and high-quality greens made it a delightful experience. Despite initial skepticism due to its location in an old garage, this place is definitely worth a try.",
    "This place is fantastic! They have a wide range of vegan options, and their staff is very knowledgeable. The Pad Thai with tofu, veggies, and cashews is absolutely perfect, and the avocado egg rolls are amazing. Highly recommend!",
    "This downtown spot is a swanky and lively place filled with good-looking professionals enjoying drinks and appetizers. The food, though not filling, is like little works of flavor art. The mussels and clams are huge and the broth is buttery and faintly spiced. Other appetizers like Tuna Tartare and Coconut Shrimp offer awesome flavor surprises. However, the cocktail \"The Tryst\" was disappointing with a watery and strange alcohol aftertaste. The service is quick and helpful, especially once seated. The prices are a bit high for food, so it's better to stick to drinks or visit during happy hours. Overall, a cool and hip place for a night out with friends or if you're looking for impressive dishes, but be prepared to spend some cash.",
    "Great customer service and delicious food, especially the flavorful curry and fluffy shrimp fried rice. However, paid extra for extra egg but did not receive it. Also, experienced a longer than expected wait time. Despite these issues, the staff's passion for serving and ensuring customer satisfaction was impressive.",
    "The fresh made pie at this place is top-notch! With its tasteful and crunchy crust, generous toppings, and fantastic flavor, it easily ranks among the best pizzas in Philly. The Cowboy steak pizza is incredibly addictive, and I couldn't resist having more than just two slices. Even when I tried it with BBQ sauce, it didn't disappoint. Personal tip: go for the half and half option to enjoy the best of both worlds!",
    "I highly recommend this mail service for frequent travelers. It's a convenient and secure place to receive mail, with after-hours access and reliable staff. While the strip mall location may have some drawbacks, the competitive price and excellent customer service make up for it.",
    "I highly recommend Heads and Tails for sensitive skin and exceptional service. Jenne made my bikini wax experience comfortable and guided me through the whole process. It was not as daunting as I expected. This clean establishment with an excellent staff is definitely worth visiting. Will definitely return!",
    "Ordered food late at night and it took over 2 hours to arrive after calling twice. No utensils or napkins provided. Food was good, but terrible service. Will not order again.",
    "The dishes at this place were delectable and beautifully presented. We tried the J Sushi and Fire Roll, both of which were fantastic. The service was top-notch and the overall value was excellent.",
    "We recently moved to town and were sad to leave behind our favorite local Mexican restaurant. However, we were pleasantly surprised when we finally tried this place. The traditional ambiance and top-notch service immediately impressed us. Their glass bottle sodas were a personal favorite, and the food was absolutely amazing. My wife loved the Taco Sombrero, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Chimichanga. If I could, I would give this place 6 stars.",
    "I had a terrible experience at this restaurant. The server was constantly on her phone, and the food portions were extremely small for the price. The only positive was that my pork leg was tender. The service was a complete fail, and the food was also a disappointment. I couldn't even order a Cuban coffee because the server was nowhere to be found. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",
    "Outstanding customer service! Wish I could rent more frequently. Unmatched experience compared to other rental services. Highly recommend!",
    "Cafe Piazza, the new replacement for Benton Park Cafe, offers a fantastic ST. LOUIS atmosphere with a captivating mural on the ceiling. The restaurant's decor is eclectic and the food is both unique and reasonably priced. It's a great choice for a slightly upscale breakfast that won't overwhelm you. Highly recommended for its ambiance, convenient location, and delicious, creative cuisine.",
    "I am a groupie and absolutely amazed by him. His chicken is tender and smoky, the best I've ever had. The creative and awesome side dishes complement his dishes perfectly. I'm sad that I could only try his dish once and now with the market construction, I can't find him. I hope he comes back soon.",
    "Attended a company event with over 2K people at the fantastic Tuscan Tower. This resort surpasses all others in the area, resembling a luxurious cruise ship. Despite being a non-smoker, I did not encounter the usual second-hand casino smoke. The highlight was having breakfast at the coffee shop and having an enjoyable conversation with the CEO/GM. It doesn't get any better than this!",
    "Wow! Incredible experience. Initially, we had low expectations due to the appearance of the plaza. However, upon stepping into the restaurant, we were greeted with a cozy traditional Indian/Thai ambiance. We ordered the mussel appetizer, Tamarind Duck, and Panang Curry with calamari. The service was prompt and unobtrusive. The mussels were tasty, but the Duck and Curry were absolutely amazing! The portion sizes matched the prices, so no feeling of being shortchanged. We plan to return to try the sushi and other duck varieties. Our taste buds are very satisfied!",
    "Corropolese is the go-to place for tomato pie in our area. No one else compares! While they have other options, tomato pie is their standout and my family always chooses them for any occasion requiring it. They are simply the best!",
    "I recently went to a birthday party at this place and it was definitely worth checking out. It was my first time there and I was really pleased. It was quiet on a Tuesday and the service was good. The beef n lobster dish was cooked well and the mashed potatoes and asparagus were very good. However, the crab and cheese balls appetizer was disappointing, lacking flavor and seasoning. The Creme Brule was solid and I would definitely order it again. Overall, I would rate it four stars due to the subpar appetizer and a shaky table, which is unnecessary for such a nice place. Despite that, I would happily go again and would recommend it to friends.",
    "My wife and I had a fantastic experience at this restaurant. Our waitress, Debbie, was exceptional. She explained the menu and specials thoroughly and answered all our questions. The food came out quickly, was delicious, and prepared exactly as ordered. We will definitely be returning. The Mac 'n' Cheese burger was amazing and the drinks, especially the Whiskey Sour, were spot on. Highly recommended!",
    "I highly recommend this independent store for holiday gifts! It was such a fun experience with pleasant staff. Hooray for finding unique gifts!",
    "Based on previous Yelp reviews, this place had a great atmosphere and a unique blend of art house, coffee house, and Animal House vibes. The service was friendly and laid-back, and the beverages were delicious. However, the food was good but not outstanding, so I would give it three stars solely based on that. However, the atmosphere and staff deserve an extra star, so I would still consider returning to try other items on the menu.",
    "Joyce is amazing! The painless experience is worth the drive from Palm Harbor. With high-tech equipment, it surpasses the horror stories told by my friends. Love it!",
    "The Quarter Stitch in NOLA is a must-visit for knitting enthusiasts. Located within walking distance from my hotel, they had a special Mardi Gras yarn in stock. I couldn't resist checking the store out twice due to their delectable selection. The staff was incredibly helpful, making my experience even better. I would definitely return to this store.",
    "The ice cream was delicious, but the service was absolutely terrible. The staff ignored us, threw napkins around, and made rude comments. They lacked professionalism and showed no respect towards paying customers.",
    "Overall, this restaurant is small but conveniently located on the wharf. Despite the limited seating, the wait time was short. Sitting at the bar was a good option. The noise level was a bit high due to the small space. The service provided was excellent. The crab sandwich was disappointing, served on plain white bread. However, the fried shrimp was enjoyable - not greasy or heavy, with moist and flavorful shrimp. It is worth noting that the menu only offers shellfish options. As a non-seafood enthusiast, I was pleasantly surprised by the shrimp and onion rings. However, my seafood enthusiast husband did not enjoy the crab sandwich. If you love shellfish and appreciate the great location, this place could be worth a try.",
    "I had the worst experience at this restaurant during brunch. The staff was unhelpful and rude, and we had to sit outside despite having a reservation. Bees were flying around our table, and when we asked to be moved inside for safety reasons, we were denied. The waitress spoke disrespectfully to us and our complaints were not addressed. The service was so terrible that we didn't even eat and would never recommend this place to anyone.",
    "This place is fantastic for unique sandwiches and caters perfectly to both health-conscious eaters and those with vegan preferences.",
    "I took on the Brew Bros. Burger challenge and, although I couldn't finish it in time, they gave me recognition and a shirt. Delicious food, friendly staff, but the challenge gave me a stomach ache for days. Didn't try the beer, but my friends said it's good. Not recommended if you intend to drink beer. It's the best deal for $24 and perfect to share with friends, except for the competition rules. I'll definitely return to conquer it next time I'm in Reno!",
    "The breakfast and service are excellent. The Sunny side skillet (under $8) with a pancake was delicious. The atmosphere and store selections surpassed all other locations.",
    "Five stars! This food truck provides excellent and efficient service. The meat is consistently juicy, and the BBQ sauce is delicious. Prices are reasonable, and if you come across this truck, don't miss the opportunity to try their offerings. You won't be disappointed.",
    "I really wanted to like this place, but my experience was disappointing. The chicken was average, lacking flavor. The sauce options were limited for me, but the recommended mayo sauces weren't impressive. The mac&cheese was salty and mediocre, making a messy combination. The bananas foster pie had a great crust, but the filling lacked bananas and was mostly empty. The highlight was the birch beer, which was refreshing. The concept, decor, and menu are good, but the food quality doesn't match the price. 2 stars.",
    "The service was extremely slow and the food was average. Even with a small group, the service was a mess as multiple servers watched one struggling server handle everything. I felt sorry for her as she had to manage drinks, serving, and running food.",
    "Impressive service, delectable food. Ribeye was divine; melty and flavorful. Huge and scrumptious burger. Bread pudding is worth the hype. Highly recommend going and sharing with friends. Pricey, but worth it.",
    "The menu is excellent, featuring locally sourced and constantly changing dishes that are a delight for your taste buds. However, reservations can be challenging to secure, so advanced planning is recommended.",
    "Spot on! \"The veg\" burger was absolutely fantastic. The combination of portabella, grilled mozzarella, pickled veg, arugula, and gauc was a delightful explosion of flavors. The cheese was perfectly fused on top, not overly melted. The citrusy and vinegary notes of the gauc and pickled veg balanced well with the bitterness of the arugula. The bun-to-contents ratio was spot on, and the potato bun was a bonus. As for the spicy fries, they were subtly spiced, reminiscent of crab fries. The portion size was just right. The atmosphere of the place reminded me of a cozy dive bar, though it's a bit small for sit-down dining.",
    "Being a vegetarian in New Orleans is challenging, but I have found some good eats. Unfortunately, Tomasito's fell below my expectations. The chips and bean and cheese burrito were okay, but I couldn't add rice because it wasn't vegetarian. Service was alright, and the flan was delicious, although \"with berries\" meant just one raspberry. Despite its drawbacks, at least there were vegetarian options available, which is not always the case in New Orleans.",
    "This Mexican restaurant exceeded my expectations - fantastic food, great drinks, and reasonable prices.",
    "The venue boasts extremely loud live music, yet offers a pleasant and quieter atmosphere on the second floor for those seeking conversation-friendly spaces.",
    "Steve from Roto-Rooter saved the day! Our new house had a sewer back-up causing a messy situation in the yard. Thanks to Steve, we're problem-free now. If we ever need help again, we'll definitely call Roto-Rooter.",
    "I reached out to Jay Fatimo at the auto repair shop via email for a written estimate on replacing my factory navigation unit in my Denali. Despite his initial suggestion to email him, I never received a response after multiple attempts. The lack of communication has made me question their reliability and ability to handle the repairs. As a result, I will be taking my business to the GMC dealer nearby.",
    "I have been a loyal fan of this place for years and their hazelnut cake is simply amazing. Their other cakes are equally delicious. Their butter cookies are a must-try, and I often get them as gifts for loved ones. The prices are fair and the quality is consistent. The staff is friendly and helpful. Overall, a wonderful experience every time.",
    "First time for lunch. Extensive and flavorful gluten-free menu. Good lunch and friendly service.",
    "The service was excellent and the event hosting was great, but the food, especially the brisket, was mediocre. The bread was tough, the mac and cheese was good, and there were issues with dirty glassware and a lack of draft options.",
    "Overall, the tour of the Mississippi on the steamboat is a good option for a relaxing day with a passive activity. The cost is average, around $28. The downside is that there are typical tourist traps like photographers, but you can decline those options. It is recommended to do some research beforehand, especially about the Natchez Native American Tribe, which adds an interesting element to the boat ride. Getting a drink can enhance the experience as well. Overall, it's a pleasant way to spend a few hours.",
    "Just visited The Fat Ham with my girlfriend and had a great experience. Small but nice vibe with welcoming staff. Impressive whiskey display. Sat at the bar and received excellent service from bartender Dan. Margarita was tasty and reasonably priced. Pimento cheese, cornbread, shrimp & grits, and hot chicken were all delicious. Shrimp & grits was my favorite dish. Dessert (raspberry cobbler) was underwhelming, but the coffee was great. Decent price point, high-end comfort food, and overall, I'll be back.",
    "Initially, we loved this place for its delicious Greek salad and gyros. The freshness of the food and the cute ambiance impressed us. However, our recent experience was disappointing. The tables were dirty, and the lamps were filled with dirt and dead bugs, immediately putting us off. Moreover, the quality of the food has significantly declined. My salad only had a bite of potato salad, and the tomato and pepper tasted off, forcing me to spit them out. My daughter's fajita bowl with chicken had a gross tomato and rubbery, charred chicken. To make matters worse, the baklava we ordered was stale. We hope the establishment cleans up and returns to its original high-quality and delicious state.",
    "Carrollton Market in New Orleans is the ultimate brunch spot that only opens once a year. It offers amazing local flavors and excellent service. Their \"biscuits and debris\" dish is so incredible that it can only be described as a \"life changing flavorgasm.\" The oyster French omelet exceeded all expectations, fulfilling everything I ever wanted in life. I am truly speechless and grateful for this outstanding experience at @Carrolltonmarket.",
    "The beer selection was excellent, although service at the bar was a bit slow.",
    "This place offers great food, especially the fish tacos and nachos. It has a nice atmosphere suitable for both family settings and night dates. They have a music beach bar, homemade ice cream, and a small playground, which makes it a great spot overall.",
    "O! Wings is the ultimate wing spot with their unbeatable Hot momma and original flavors. Their bulgogi wrap is also a must-try. Even my picky dad couldn't resist their wings and wrap! The staff's friendliness and accommodating attitude make the experience even better. Our to go order for 16 people was handled smoothly and efficiently, getting us out the door in no time. Can't wait for our next visit!",
    "New York Pizza Grill: Unwanted fliers, unsafe practices, and questionable employees make this a place to avoid.",
    "This place was fast and efficient, despite being busy. The building is spacious and offers entertainment for kids. They have a variety of items for purchase to keep you occupied while waiting. The car was well-cleaned and vacuumed, except for a missed spot on the front window. The staff was friendly and the price was fair. I will definitely return in the future.",
    "I highly recommend this place in Indiana! David's pink and whites are absolutely amazing. The shop is always clean, and the staff is professional and courteous. The new management, although they've been there for three years already, is outstanding.",
    "I had a disappointing experience with this restaurant. Despite quick delivery, my entire order was incorrect. They offered a free meal as compensation, but refused to provide it when requested. I threatened to dispute the payment and mentioned not returning as a customer. Overall, a frustrating experience.",
    "A perfect afternoon in the gulch would consist of a shopping spree at Blush, a beer at Hops and Crafts, and lunch at Turnip Truck. Turnip Truck offers a great selection of organic fair, including tasty hot buffet options and made-to-order sandwiches. They also have all-natural beauty products and lip balms. The only drawback is the lack of a rewards program. I highly recommend trying their chipotle chicken salad wrap on whole wheat with chipotle mayo.",
    "The happy hour and brunch at this place are great. Dinner was just okay, but I think it was because I ordered something outside of my usual taste. I'll definitely give it another try.",
    "Three of us flew in from Chicago and decided to stop by this place for a quick bite. We arrived close to 3 and asked if we could wait until happy hour to order. Despite being empty, the place was nicely decorated and had a spacious feel. We all tried their cocktails, with the Mint Julep falling short but the gin drink exceeding expectations. Our order also included Mac and cheese, fries, Brussels sprouts, and a pretzel. I skipped the sprouts, but everything else was delicious! The prices during happy hour were a steal. Rest assured, I'll be back on my next trip to Reno!",
    "Finding a vegetarian restaurant in New Orleans was initially challenging, as many places were unwilling to accommodate our needs. However, in recent years, more restaurants are recognizing this and offering vegetarian options. Muriel's Jackson Square had a vegetarian menu, and we made reservations to ensure we would be able to eat. The cocktails were delicious, and we enjoyed the veggie crepe, despite the seafood sauce. The main course was a variety of veggie dishes, some of which were tasty, but some could have been cooked longer. Overall, we left with satisfied stomachs and had a pleasant vegetarian night out.",
    "I had a delicious meal at Puckett's with their mighty tasty meat-and-two option. The squash casserole and meatloaf were top-notch. The cornbread, while advertised as such, was more like a corn fritter or hoe cake. Overall, highly recommended for a traditional and flavorful experience.",
    "I have been a loyal guest at The Grand Sierra for years, but due to recent construction and changes, I decided to try the Peppermill upon a friend's recommendation. The Operations Manager, David Fuller, exceeded my expectations and made my stay truly exceptional. We were pleasantly surprised with a double upgrade to a Tuscany Balcony Suite, complete with a balcony, which set the tone for a perfect trip. The staff's dedication and willingness to go the extra mile made my experience even better than I had anticipated. Thank you, Peppermill! I will definitely return.",
    "The Hilton property I stayed at was disappointing. The customer service was terrible, and even though I made a reservation for a suite, it wasn't ready. They offered me a lower grade room with a promise to switch later, but when I returned, they had sold my reserved room. The excuses and apologies were fake, and no satisfactory resolution was offered. I won't be staying here again.",
    "The burger was mediocre and overpriced. Uncomfortable communal seating and average service. Lowering prices would greatly improve the experience. Many better options in St. Louis for taste and value.",
    "I obtained multiple quotes and found Pete and Ron to be the best. Arbour Bay assured me I made a good choice. They efficiently removed two large oaks, one challenging to access, using a crane. I left in the morning and returned to find the trees gone with minimal yard damage. Highly recommend to friends and neighbors.",
    "I was disappointed to discover a significant price increase at this establishment, with basic sushi rolls now costing nearly $20 for two. Though the portions were generous, they were not satisfying enough to warrant such steep prices for a lunch meal. Regrettably, I won't be returning due to these high prices.",
    "The atmosphere and service were excellent! The live music was a pleasant surprise, and the band was very talented. The food was good, although the burger didn't meet my high expectations. Overall, we had a great time and will definitely return.",
    "Overall, our 2 1/2 day corporate conference in mid-June was a great experience. The service was excellent, the facilities were pleasant, and the catering was impressive. The location is perfect for conferences or small conventions, with convenient amenities such as complimentary shuttle and parking near the airport.",
    "This place is an absolute gem for cheese lovers looking to share a delightful variety with friends, paired with a wide selection of drinks. The staff's impressive knowledge of each cheese adds to the overall experience. Although not budget-friendly for drinks, I would definitely return. A solid 5-star rating.",
    "Disappointing Middle Eastern experience with subpar side dishes; seemingly reheated rice lacked flavor and freshness.",
    "I highly recommend this place for lunch. The Salmon dish is a must-try, and the service is excellent. The restrooms are also very clean.",
    "This place is top notch with phenomenal service, fantastic ambiance, and amazing food. Best brunch experience ever, with delicious French toast and unreal chicken and waffles. The \"flintstones pushup-pop\" drink is creative and clever. Even the deviled eggs were the best I've ever had. Everything is done right, from the music to the overall experience. Ignore any review that's not 4 stars, they must be delusional.",
    "I randomly stumbled upon this place and I'm glad I did. They have an awesome happy hour from 3-8pm every day with great deals on drinks and hookah. They offer a variety of shisha flavors and unique options like smoking from a fruit bowl. The food menu looked tempting, although I didn't try it. The atmosphere is laid-back and perfect for hanging out with friends. I had a fantastic time here.",
    "I absolutely love this hotel! The lobby is adorable with comfortable seating and eclectic decorations. The staff, including Jasmine, Kayla, and Roshid, are amazing and friendly. The rooms are immaculate, especially the fantastic bathrooms in the king spa rooms. The decor is attractive and everything is in perfect condition. This hotel is a must-visit in Philadelphia, with a great location near historical sites. Stay at the Monaco, you won't regret it!",
    "I am absolutely obsessed with this store! Being an addict, I just can't resist. The price I paid for a Bebe top, a Banana Republic skirt, and a BCBG skirt was only $4.13. Ridiculous savings!",
    "Love this family-friendly spot in Carp to watch football! The atmosphere is excellent, service is quick, and the pizza is absolutely delicious.",
    "This Acme store was generally what you would expect, with the only noticeable difference being slightly narrower aisles. While it may not offer as much variety as larger stores, it had upgraded sections like frozen and refrigerated foods. The service provided was satisfactory.",
    "My wife and I recently discovered The Roost and it has quickly become our favorite breakfast spot in the area. Their homemade breads and pastries are a treat; the raisin bread and sugar-cinnamon toast are especially delicious. We also highly recommend the cornbread casserole. The service is prompt, attentive, and incredibly friendly. We can't wait to go back!",
    "Despite its small and crowded atmosphere, this breakfast place serves delicious and abundant food. The efficient wait staff manages the hectic environment exceptionally well. Overall, a fantastic spot for breakfast.",
    "Finally tried this place after passing by so many times and I'm glad we did. Despite the small size, the interior is visually pleasing with wooden palates and two-tone gray walls. The prosciutto fig arugula Parmesan flatbread appetizer was tasty and ample for two people. The main dishes, particularly the grass-fed beef burger with truffle-dusted fries, were impressive in size and flavor. I also enjoyed the seafood soup with a coconut and curry broth. It had a delicious spicy kick without overpowering the taste buds. Overall, I would highly recommend this place. Just a heads up, it gets crowded and doesn't take reservations, so best to go early. Don't forget to try their great selection of wines and craft beers.",
    "I found the food at Dragon Buffet to be mediocre and not worth the higher price for crab legs. The meats were dried out and fried foods were soggy and tough. Service was slow, possibly due to limited staff. There are better Chinese buffets in the area, so I may not return.",
    "This is our go-to place! The food is consistently good with friendly and attentive service. The pasta pockets with pear filling are delicious. BYOB is a bonus. Highly recommend for a cozy, family atmosphere.",
    "This bar is ordinary and only notable for its connection to a popular TV show. The food, including the pricey gravy fries, is nothing outstanding. However, they had a special offer on White Rascal beer priced at $4. The service is generally good, although occasionally slow, but the staff is friendly.",
    "I went to this place based on Yelp reviews and found everything to be true. The staff is super helpful and eager to answer any questions. I'll definitely keep coming back for my bike repair and maintenance needs.",
    "The hotel offers great value with a pleasant atmosphere. The king bed and tasteful furnishings were impressive. The Carousel bar was a fun experience, and the rooftop pool was perfect for hot days. However, beware of loud noise from the street-facing rooms, particularly on weekends. Additionally, ensure the removal of the extra $60 nightly charge for incidentals.",
    "The handmade Orangina is a delightful treat, surpassing the bottled version in taste. The croissant sandwiches are simply exceptional.",
    "Fantastic food, especially the milkshakes, ice cream, Chicago dogs, and cheese fries. It's always a satisfying experience at an affordable price. Highly recommended!",
    "The food is excellent, with exceptional service from servers like Jamie White. However, the absence of Bud Light on tap is a major downside.",
    "The food at this place is top-notch, earning it a five-star rating. The atmosphere may lack a bit, but the delicious dinners made up for it. The Chicken Tikka and Malai Kofta were both loved, and the prices were reasonable. Already planning a return trip.",
    "I have been a loyal customer at this hotel/casino for a year now and recently had my 5th visit. As a player card member, I receive regular free or discounted room offers, which I love. The hotel is very nice and I have never had a bad experience. I appreciate the convenience of checking in online and using the express kiosk to avoid long lines. The rooms are always clean, comfortable, and offer nice views of the pool. The pool itself is relaxing and never too crowded. Although the spa is nice, it is a bit pricey. I haven't had great experiences at the restaurants I've tried so far, but I'm looking forward to trying the steakhouse and Chi. The slots are usually not crowded, allowing me to enjoy my favorite machines without delays. Overall, I enjoy visiting and will continue to return as long as I receive great offers.",
    "I had a mouthwatering bagel sandwich this morning - pork roll, egg and cheese on an everything bagel. Reasonably priced at $4.23 and freshly made on site. However, the limited staff seems overwhelmed by the crowd.",
    "The restaurant's set tasting menu on Sundays is disappointing as they serve the same portion size to both solo diners and multiple parties. While the food was delicious, the lack of consideration for individual servings and the business approach made the experience unacceptable. Not recommended for a return visit.",
    "I highly recommend this place for anyone interested in baking or cooking. Attended a pizza making class and had an amazing time. Learned valuable techniques from the knowledgeable instructor, John from Ornesto. Met wonderful people and truly enjoyed the experience. This place is like Disneyland for bakers, chefs, and aspiring chefs. Already booked another class and bought some great products. It may be a bit hard to find due to dim lighting, but it's worth the search. Check it out!",
    "I highly recommend this place! Amazing vegetarian and organic menu, staff are friendly and helpful, and the coffee is delicious. I will definitely be returning.",
    "Absolutely love this place! The veggie burger is hands down the best in town with its handmade patty. And those pretzel buns? Wow, yum!",
    "Ploy Thai exceeded my expectations for lunch. Despite my disappointment with Tampa's food scene after moving from Los Angeles, this place earned a well-deserved 4-star rating. The flavors were incredible and the ingredients exceptionally fresh. Highly recommend!",
    "The crust was dry and the Delmar pizza lacked enough BBQ sauce, resulting in a dry taste. However, the server provided good service. Disappointingly, the pizza took an excessively long time to be served, leaving us waiting after finishing our salads.",
    "Great food and coffee, but the long wait in line for the one cashier needs improvement. Adding another cashier is necessary to avoid frustrating customers and potential downfall.",
    "Peppermill excels in service and accommodations, surpassing all expectations. The gaming experience, particularly on the $1 or 25 cent slots, yields favorable results. Having spent a significant amount of time and money here, I can confidently say that Peppermill is Reno's finest. Their food is exceptional, and the prices are reasonable.",
    "Terribly disappointed with the overpriced and underwhelming experience. The sausage/egg/cheese sandwich was cold and significantly smaller than depicted. Presentation on large plates was just embarrassing. The bacon/egg/cheese sandwich on brioche was equally disappointing with a cold egg and excessive greasiness. Comparable food can be found at McDonald's for a fraction of the price.",
    "I initially had a good experience at Music City Optical, but things went downhill when they switched my contact brand without proper explanation. I experienced pain, redness, and irritation, and when I reached out to them, they were unresponsive. Eventually, I managed to get my contacts switched back, but later found out that my eye irritation was due to not giving my eyes enough time to heal. When I posted a review on Facebook, they accused me of slander and lying, which was not accurate.",
    "I recently visited the Italian Centre for a quick lunch and pastries. The Mossimo pizza was amazing - fresh toppings, bubbly cheese, and a thin, perfectly baked crust. It was a steal at just $14 and big enough to share. The Cream Horns were pricy but absolutely delicious - fresh, creamy, and flakey. I recommend enjoying a coffee beverage and pastry while shopping - the perfect treat.",
    "I am deeply disappointed with the decline in service at my usual nail salon. The front desk staff showed minimal interest, failed to prioritize customers, and lacked professionalism. I experienced delays, cold water, and subpar service during my pedicure. Additionally, the prices have increased without any added value. Despite the convenient hours, I have decided not to return due to repeated negative experiences and staff turnover.",
    "Boulevard Pizza is our top choice in Sparks/Reno. Despite its outdated decor, the mouthwatering pizza they serve makes up for it. The added bonus of fun arcade games for kids is a definite plus.",
    "This coffee shop is simply the best I've ever been to. Their drinks, both iced and hot, are incredible. The only downside is the long line, but the efficient and friendly staff make up for it.",
    "The donuts at this place were amazing! I tried the plain glazed and the lemon filled one, and both were incredible. If I ever come back to Indy, I would definitely visit again.",
    "The food at this place is amazing, especially their jumbo wings on Wednesdays for only $1. The Dirty Lemonade is a must-try drink. Don't miss out if you're in Indianapolis!",
    "Don't judge this hole-in-the-wall spot by its appearance; it's a hidden gem. The food is absolutely fantastic. Their gyros, fish, and chicken are prepared and seasoned to perfection. Don't forget to save room for dessert \u2013 it's a must-try.",
    "Fantastic first day! The place was packed, but impressively well-organized. My family and I had a great time and we'll definitely be returning multiple times a week. Thank you for coming to Reno!",
    "I absolutely love Baguette Deli! Their BBQ pork sandwiches are amazing, and the staff is incredibly friendly. This was my first experience with Vietnamese cuisine, and I can't wait to try more. The bubble tea is delicious, and I'm glad to have another place in town to get it. The fresh rolls are just as good as sit-down Thai restaurants, and I appreciate that they will add extra jalapenos without charging extra. Definitely try Baguette Deli - they're simply excellent!",
    "I highly recommend this place for their amazing brisket tacos and brisket quesadillas. The happy hour starting at 3 is a great option for a late lunch with 2-for-1 drinks.",
    "Xtreme Tacos is my go-to place for delicious food and amazing service. I've ordered from them multiple times, and everything has been consistently delicious. The homemade chips are simply outstanding and must-have. The salsa and queso are perfect for dipping. In addition to the amazing food, the staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming, especially the guy at the counter. Highly recommended!",
    "I recently moved downtown and have been on the search for the best services in each category. As a woman, trust is important to me, especially when it comes to auto service. I highly recommend Cabrillo Union 76 for their quality service, repair, and smog checks. Thank you, Ray and the staff, for a job well done. Sincerely, Cheyenne.",
    "Great location for hungry tourists with an edgy yet chill atmosphere. Ahi fish tacos with avocado relish sounded amazing. Popular spot with a good selection of local microbrews. Tacos arrived in premade shells, which made me hesitant, but the fish flavor was excellent. Limited avocado but tasty sauce. The brunch menu looks promising as well.",
    "Incredible breakfast pizza, bottomless mimosas and bloody marys, with exceptional service! Rare to find such an amazing experience these days.",
    "I highly recommend Bing's boba in Tucson for their amazing Taro snow and overall great experience. The place is clean, offers board games, and has a helpful and friendly staff. They even replaced a drink for my husband when it didn't meet his flavor preference. Best boba spot in town!",
    "I highly recommend Venus Nail! I discovered them through a Google search and have been there three times already. The salon has a wonderful atmosphere and provides excellent service. Ivy, in particular, is fantastic! When I mentioned my upcoming birthday trip, she came up with an amazing nail design that I absolutely loved.",
    "This hidden gem in an unexpected location exceeded my expectations for an Indian restaurant. The peach chutney with Naan was divine, and the Lamb Korma had just the right amount of spice. The ambiance and friendly staff added to the overall delightful experience. Despite the distance, I would highly recommend making the drive to this authentic and impressive establishment.",
    "Greko is a must-try! I had an amazing experience trying their rotisserie chicken pita and fries for lunch, and I loved it so much that I went back for dinner and lunch the next day. The Horta Greens salad and Athenian Chicken are also highly recommended. This casual restaurant truly focuses on providing great food.",
    "Brother Rabbit at Compere Lapin is a fantastic addition to the New Orleans food scene. From the refreshing house cider to the phenomenal Oban 18, the drinks are top-notch. The house biscuits and butter are simply divine, a must-try. While the crispy chicken skins lacked flavor, the rest of the first course menu, including the daily oysters and marinated shrimp with jalape\u00f1o jus, were delicious and fresh. Lastly, the dobeger cake with lemon curd and chocolate ice cream topped with a heavenly chocolate sauce is a perfect ending. Whether you're with a group or on a date night, Brother Rabbit is a great choice.",
    "Overall, I would not recommend Imo's for their St. Louis Style pizza. The cheese tasted different and the pizza wasn't cut all the way through, making it difficult to separate each slice. However, the toasted ravioli was outstanding, despite the watery sauce. Next time, I would only order the ravioli.",
    "Mazzaros: Unbeatable authentic Italian cuisine! Their sauce and meatballs are simply divine.",
    "The Mandarin is a trendy dance club that offers a variety of cocktails and beers. The door charge for guys on certain nights is common in the industry. The enclosed patio is spacious even during winter. The music is hit-or-miss, ranging from enjoyable hip-hop and pop to un-danceable tunes. Talking inside is difficult due to the loud music. If you're in the CWE and in the mood for dancing, the Mandarin is worth a try.",
    "Great spot on Frenchmen! Managed to grab a corner table just in time and enjoyed the wonderful piano tunes. The food was delicious - loved the pork pot stickers and smoked hanger steak. The lobster eggrolls exceeded expectations. Good selection of drinks and great happy hour deals. The fusion of Asian and French cuisine is a nice touch. We'll be back for sure!",
    "The overall dining experience was average due to okay food quality. However, the restaurant felt overcrowded with too many tables and limited space, leading to a rushed atmosphere. We frequently experienced disruptions from other servers and customers bumping into our chairs.",
    "Terrible experience at a crappy restaurant with awful service and a rude waiter. Avoid at all costs! Instead, highly recommend La Baia on 17th and Lombard if you're looking for a fantastic BYO Italian restaurant.",
    "The new Randall's in West County is a welcome addition. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The beer selection is impressive, offering a wide range of styles. Prices are competitive, making it a worthwhile shopping experience.",
    "Deseree is the ultimate hairstylist who has been perfecting my hair for 10+ years. She's a versatile expert, transforming me from blonde to brunette and handling all lengths flawlessly. I trust her exclusively, especially for my wedding where she'll style not just me but also 6 bridesmaids. I have complete confidence in her ability to make us all look picture perfect. Deseree is not just accommodating, dependable, and experienced, but also incredibly hilarious.",
    "The service at Sockeye Grill was terrible, with slow service and tasteless salads. However, the salmon was excellent and the waitress was knowledgeable about beer. The finger steaks were mushy and the atmosphere was more like a warehouse than a restaurant, with depressing news on the TVs. Overall, the restaurant needs improvement and we won't be returning.",
    "We had a fantastic dinner on St. Patrick's day for my sister's birthday. The server and bartender were incredibly kind and accommodating. The food, including tri-tip, pulled pork, and rotisserie chicken, was all delicious, except for the veggie burrito which was disappointing (but who orders a veggie burrito at a rotisserie grill?). The prices were reasonable, portions were good, and the service was top-notch. We will definitely return, except for the vegetarian in our group.",
    "Anders Osborne's performance at this venue was a true highlight of my NOLA trip. Despite heading straight to Bourbon Street afterwards, I regret not staying longer. The enticing smell of the food, affordable drinks, and laid-back crowd added to the overall experience.",
    "Despite being highly recommended by native Philadelphians, my experience at Ralph's Italian restaurant was quite underwhelming. The grilled calamari appetizer was drenched in a salty red sauce, overpowering the flavor of the calamari itself. The pasta bolognese with filet mignon tips was mediocre, with another overly salty red sauce and average quality beef. The black lobster ravioli was decent but also excessively salty. Considering the restaurant's reputation as the oldest Italian restaurant in the country, our expectations were not met.",
    "MCLifeTucson: A breathtaking escape in the Catalina Mountains. Perfect for running or hiking, this high desert oasis mesmerizes with its natural beauty. We can't get enough of the canyon!",
    "The beer service at this burger joint with a large craft beer selection was lackluster. The first beer I ordered had an off flavor, but when I tried another similar dark beer, it was fine. The bartender didn't bother to investigate the off flavor, suggesting a lack of beer knowledge. Additionally, they served beers in inferior glassware and kept the shaker pints too cold. The overall beer knowledge here was not up to par.",
    "I absolutely love Orangetheory! It's hands down the best full body workout I've ever done. With a great variety of classes, it's always convenient for me to find a session that fits my schedule.",
    "The tour was fantastic! Raymond, our guide, was incredibly knowledgeable and made the experience enjoyable. The food stops were delicious. Definitely worth the time and money.",
    "Rons remains a consistent favorite of mine. Great craft beer selection, particularly impressive this week. The food is enjoyable, as long as you choose wisely from the menu.",
    "The freshly made donuts at this place are amazing! I had to wait a bit for them to cool down, but it was worth it. The clean and not overcrowded location is a great addition to the neighborhood. Plus, they have a parking lot, which is a bonus. Definitely the best donuts in Philly and the Delaware Valley.",
    "This Econo Lodge was a disappointing experience. The rooms were dirty and the staff seemed unwilling to acknowledge or address the issue. The manager was unhelpful and sarcastic. Additionally, the lack of cleanliness in the room was evident, as they only checked the microwave and fridge without cleaning anything else. I would not recommend staying at this Econo Lodge as it does not meet basic standards of cleanliness. Opt for a reputable hotel brand like Marriott, Starwood, or Hilton where customer satisfaction is a priority.",
    "Cafe Soleil exceeded my high expectations for authentic French pastries. The croissants were buttery, flaky, and better than some I've had in France. Nico, the French baker, brings a noticeable difference in taste to the food. While the distance is a drawback, I will definitely be returning to satisfy my sweet tooth. Highly recommended bakery.",
    "This neighborhood BYOB place is a hidden gem. Excellent food, welcoming service, and reasonable prices make it stand out. The menu offers a variety of delicious Italian dishes, both traditional and unique. The specials are always a good choice. The atmosphere is friendly and the staff makes you feel like a regular. Conveniently located near sports venues and accessible by public transportation. Make sure to make a reservation as it can get busy. Overall, a must-try if you're in the area.",
    "Todd Cobell's work is fantastic - you can never go wrong with it!",
    "We are frequent patrons who love the super fun bar, TVs, and music at this establishment. The service is excellent, with hard-working and polite staff creating a cool atmosphere. The seafood is always fresh and delicious, while the pizza is the best in South Jersey. The thin and crispy crust, with a nice chew and great flavor, makes it the best pizza we've ever had. We recently tried a dinner special, a chicken cutlet in a lobster, white truffle oil, light cream sauce with asparagus, shallots, and sundried tomatoes over angel hair pasta. It was delicately seasoned and generously portioned, and we enjoyed it so much that we want to order it again. The bartenders, Selena, Jayna, and Chris, are pleasant and professional, making it an enjoyable place to go. Overall, it's a fabulous place to have a good time.",
    "Despina at EWC is a true waxing godsend! She is quick, friendly, and professional, leaving you feeling fresh and satisfied. The waxing experience with her surpasses any strip junk; it's simply excellent. Despina's expertise extends to making eyebrows on fleek, and her attentive listening skills enhance the overall experience. Thanks to Despina, I actually enjoy my waxing appointments. She is truly the best in the biz!",
    "Mixed feelings. The driver was incredibly friendly, and the pizza tasted great. However, it arrived barely warm, which has now happened twice. Hoping they'll address this issue soon, but I'll be exploring other options for now.",
    "Impeccable food and service at Sbraga! The chefs counter 6 course with wine pairings was worth the price. The front row view of the deliciousness being prepared was amazing. The talented team ran like a well-oiled machine. Highlights include the Gruyere popover with foie gras soup, saffron spaghetti with blue crab, crispy Arctic char, and even the chicken liver mousse (surprisingly delicious). The wines were perfectly matched. Special birthday celebrations were made extra memorable with a note from Sbraga and a thoughtful goodie bag. Already looking forward to a return visit!",
    "If you're looking for unique and delicious options, I highly recommend GlobalQ. Their quesadillas and wraps range from good to phenomenal, with some pretty unique combinations. Portions are generous, and I usually have leftovers. Try the 'Montreal' or 'New Orleans' wraps for something different. Don't miss out on the secret menu 'French Dip' quesadilla. The best part is that they offer delivery.",
    "Wendy's has drastically improved - their new sea salt fries are a revelation. Exceptional quality for fast food, a game-changer. I rarely rate fast food, but this deserves recognition.",
    "Recently, I dined here twice and was extremely dissatisfied. The service was lacking and the food failed to impress, which was quite disappointing considering our previous enjoyable experiences. Regrettably, I don't think I will be returning, as this restaurant is no longer worth the expense.",
    "I was disappointed with my recent visit to this DSW location. Compared to the Marlton store, I found fewer shoe options and lower quality in the clearance section. The new layout made it feel like a warehouse, which was not the experience I expected. The lack of assistance and attention from staff was also frustrating.",
    "That BBQ Place may have neat ambiance and friendly service, but its overpriced menu, lack of cutlery and table service, and moist ribs with no bark were disappointing. While Sherwood Park locals seem to enjoy it, I won't be returning.",
    "The store is severely understaffed, resulting in lengthy wait times at checkout, sometimes up to 25 minutes. It is advisable to avoid this store if possible. While the workers are pleasant, it seems that the understaffing may be intentional to enhance profit margins.",
    "Stopped by Mel's for lunch and had the amazing turkey club sandwich. Cook/waiter was friendly and served it with a smile. Packed with fresh turkey on tasty multi-grain toast. Saw the next day's pork roast - heavenly. Excited to return for pork sandwich and breakfast.",
    "The tacos and tortas are amazing, and the service is quick. This place offers authentic Mexican fare, and they also have a variety of delicious baked goods.",
    "We had an amazing honeymoon at the Monteleone in New Orleans. The beautiful decor, attentive staff, and convenient location made it the perfect choice for exploring the city. The rooftop pool and jacuzzi tub added to the incredible experience. Can't wait to return!",
    "The dining room needs improvement, but the salad was good. However, the bread portion was insufficient. Disappointed that sweet tea was not available. Noticed a booth with unsupervised children for quite some time, one of them sleeping. Eventually, an employee attended to them, possibly bringing them to work. Concerned for their safety as they were small and alone.",
    "Outstanding dining experience! Great ambiance, exceptional service, and delicious food. Perfect for celebrating special occasions.",
    "I walked into Blaze at 9pm only to be told they were closed, despite their stated hours online and on the door. Disappointed with my first experience at this new pizzeria. A simple explanation for the time change would have been appreciated.",
    "Dr. Dayley is the best dentist I've ever been to! I used to have a lot of anxiety about dental work due to a traumatic experience in the past, but Dr. Dayley is extremely personable and helps calm my nerves. He removed all four of my wisdom teeth and I completely trust him with my dental care. I highly recommend him to everyone I know, and my entire family also sees him. The front desk and staff are welcoming and sweet. Thank you for being the best dentist office!",
    "I was thrilled to discover P.F. Chang's fast food restaurant, but the atmosphere was different and more like regular fast food. Despite that, the efficient order system and quick service impressed me. The food tasted amazing for its speedy preparation and affordable price. I highly recommend giving it a try.",
    "I absolutely recommend this place for blow outs! The talented staff, convenient online booking, and friendly service make it top-notch. I personally love Krissy and Bianca, but everyone is great. Don't forget to try the vital shot, it's a game-changer for conditioning blondes like me and lasts about a week!",
    "I'm very disappointed with the food from this restaurant. The presentation was good and the delivery was prompt, but everything else fell short. The sushi was mushy and warm due to being packed with hot food, and the rainbow roll had avocado instead of raw fish. The calamari was undercooked and had breading falling off, so I couldn't eat it. The chicken lettuce wraps were also not as described on the menu. I won't be ordering from here again. I'll stick to Niji's on 5th.",
    "The bartender's service was incredibly disappointing, catering mainly to regular customers. Despite being ready to order with money in hand, I was neglected. Frustrating experience overall.",
    "I had a post-show snack at Normand's Bistro and overall, it was a decent option. The menu seemed a bit overpriced, especially for the Caesar salad with three 'jumbo' shrimp. However, the flavors were good and the ingredients were fresh. My friend enjoyed her soup and smoked salmon Carpaccio. The restaurant also had interesting beers on the menu. If you're in the area and looking for a drink or snack after a show, this place is worth considering. They had a variety of appetizers and desserts to suit different tastes.",
    "I had a fantastic experience at the store! The managers, especially Tonya, were incredibly helpful and resolved our shirt exchange issue with ease. Highly recommend!",
    "I love this place! Great variety of toys and always try to visit during sales. Pets are welcome and the staff is caring and friendly. Great answers to my questions and it feels like a neighborhood pet store despite being a chain.",
    "I rate it two stars due to excellent service and friendly staff. However, the food was subpar, possibly due to a bad day. My order from the German section turned out to be just a pretzel and a piece of sausage in a box, disappointing overall.",
    "I've been a long-time fan of Charlie's and returned recently due to jean troubles. The attentive girl who assisted me was fantastic, offering an array of options and explaining the various fits and washes patiently. Ultimately, I bought two pairs of Sebastian McCalls, which are both cute and comfortable. Love this place!",
    "Went on Senior Discount Day, disappointed by lack of cleaning and poor customer service. Dirt smudges on the car, incomplete vacuuming, and unhelpful manager. Would not recommend.",
    "I had the seafood combo-catfish, red beans and rice, and coleslaw at this place and it was pretty damn good. The real reason we went in was the happy hour deal: 2 for 1 from 4pm-7pm, Mon-Sat. I ordered a margarita, being from California I have high standards, it wasn't bad but the food made up for it!",
    "I have been to this place many times and every experience has been great. My husband and I used to go there almost weekly after working on our house. The place is always clean, they never rush through the session, and they focus on problem areas. Felicia is amazing and highly recommended. I recently had a therapeutic massage with her for my neck pain and it was truly incredible. She is extremely talented.",
    "The Sunrise Family Restaurant offers a cozy, small-town vibe and the service is prompt and friendly. However, the recommended Monte Cristo sandwich was disappointing - microwaved turkey and ham with limp french toast. The salad and fries were tasty though, especially the perfectly cooked thick steak fries. Despite the sandwich, I believe there may be great options on the menu, particularly for breakfast. I plan to give it another shot.",
    "First time at Butcher & Bee for lunch with my husband and co-workers. The place has a cute farmhouse feel and offers a bit of privacy with its booths. Despite being a bit tight for a group of 7, we were seated right away. I tried the pork belly gnocchi, which was good but lacked texture. It would've been better if the pork belly was crispy. My husband was disappointed with the trout sandwich, as it resembled a tuna salad. We enjoyed the coconut macaroons for dessert, but the co-workers had mixed reviews. One person liked the KFC sandwich. We'll definitely give this place another try. The use of books as bill holders is cute too!",
    "This event is a blast for beer enthusiasts, with a great variety of affordable sample drinks. However, the food is overpriced. Buying favorite brews on-site is convenient, with special offers from the liquor store. VIP experience isn't worth it, unless you really value the glass mug. The venue's parking fees and on-site ticket purchases can make it costly.",
    "Kiwi Nail is an unprofessional salon that prioritizes shortcuts over quality. The shabby job on my French tip fill was made worse when the nail tech tried to fix it by painting over the mess and applying excessive varnish. Additionally, the inability to tip by card and being forced to pay cash was inconvenient and unprofessional. I will not be returning and recommend others to avoid this place.",
    "Chick fil A sets itself apart from typical fast food with exceptionally high-quality food that doesn't feel laden with fillers. Highly recommend even for non-fast food enthusiasts!",
    "Square 1682 is an upscale hotel bar that I frequent for lunch, brunch, dinner, and happy hour. The food is great, service is excellent, and the space is upscale. It always attracts a nice group of people, whether they are staying at the hotel or live/work in the area. But the best part is the bartender, Dan, who works on Mondays. He is my favorite bartender in the city and always knows exactly what I want. I even walk by if he's not working. Love him and have made many wonderful memories at this establishment.",
    "This place is a must-try. We come here often and are always satisfied. Arriving early is recommended to avoid waiting. They offer a good selection of coffees, including French press. The menu is not overwhelming, making it easy to decide quickly. The food arrives in a reasonable time and is consistently fresh. The friendly staff adds to the positive experience. I highly recommend the Wilburt skillet \u2013 it's amazing. You'll leave feeling full and with a smile on your face.",
    "I gave this place multiple chances, but unfortunately, the service was consistently disappointing. The first wax was with Despina who was uncommunicative and missed chunks of hair. The second wax with Amy Jo was friendlier, but still sloppy, leaving a significant amount of hair. The timing was also rushed, with the appointment lasting only 8 minutes. Considering the price, I expected much better. The staff at the front desk were rude and unhelpful, and asking about tipping was uncomfortable. I'll have to continue my search for a decent Brazilian wax in Philly.",
    "Amazing atmosphere, unique flavors, and a must-try Cuban Lamb Frita (add the egg!). Delicious side dishes with friendly and efficient staff. My new favorite brunch spot!",
    "This place has its ups and downs. Small portions for high prices, but cheap drinks and excellent service. The piano adds a nice touch. However, the cheesecake is absolutely incredible - a must-try!",
    "If you manage to beat the crowd, you're in for a treat. The only downside is the small size. However, everything on the menu is simply amazing, including their options for vegetarians and vegans. I highly recommend trying their French toast specials. This place is a must-visit for breakfast before heading to the Mardi Gras parades.",
    "Butch did an excellent job on the tour - it was both relaxing and informative. The two stops to eat and see the cemetery were great additions. I highly recommend going on this trip at the beginning of your stay as it helps you know where to go during your trip. Butch was also a lot of fun!",
    "This food truck is a hidden gem with delicious and unique street food options. The captain crunch tilapia burrito is a surprisingly tasty combination of flakey fish, fresh veggies, and flavorful Sriracha mayo. The katsu and curry chicken are also flavorful and rich. And don't miss their refreshing Thai tea. Despite being a small food truck, they offer a wide variety of options. The friendly service and affordable prices make it worth the drive if you're in Jersey.",
    "I had a terrible day with a migraine and sinus infection, but Massage Envy came to the rescue. They fit me and my father in for massages, provided great service, and even taught me some techniques to try at home. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was calming, and the membership program is worth it. I already feel so much better and will be going back for a longer session next month. Recommended!",
    "This place offers the best roast chicken I've ever tried. The chicken itself is moist and crispy with a nice smoky flavor. The aroma is hypnotizing and makes your mouth water. The double chicken family meal is perfect for a family of four, with ample portions of chicken, fries, and cole slaw. The dipping sauces, particularly the mustard-based one with a chipotle flair, are delicious. The wedge fries are filling and there are plenty to go around. The portion size was so big that we had leftovers. The service is excellent, and the owners are friendly. I would choose this place over Popeyes or KFC due to the generous portions, healthier options, and better service. I will definitely be returning because I know I'll be craving their delicious chicken.",
    "I highly recommend this place for those looking for a taste of Japanese cuisine without the focus on sushi. Their rice bowls and tempura are delicious, and the restaurant is rarely crowded. They also offer catering services for sushi and maki platters. The service is quick and the place is great for a fast lunch or dinner when you're in a hurry.",
    "Highly satisfied with my experience at this dentist in Westchase. Convenient location, friendly staff, and both Dr. Creech-Gionis and Dr. Stern are exceptional. Going to the dentist is now less painful, and I'm 100% satisfied.",
    "Amigos on our 40th anniversary was disappointing. Lacked atmosphere, mediocre food, and high prices. Overrated salsa and average chips. Prefer the taco trucks or Gloria's despite its cleanliness issues. $47.00, drinks, and tip. Desperately seeking decent Mexican fare in Boise.",
    "Heather's service as a waitress and bartender was exceptional. The food, especially the tenderloin sliders with french fries, was divine. I will definitely be a regular customer of this place. Highly recommend trying it out.",
    "The bouncers at this place are terrible, but given their height and rage-filled past, it's not surprising. This establishment epitomizes everything Reno should not be. Choose LEX only if your only other option is enduring waterboarding on Thanksgiving.",
    "This place is a must-visit for sandwich lovers on the beach! The gourmet servings and friendly service make it stand out from the rest. The shrimp tacos were cooked perfectly and the Kiwi sauce added a delightful twist. The only downside is the limited seating options. Overall, it's a local favorite with 5-star food!",
    "Stunning and contemporary venue with a lovely view, only drawback being its proximity to the train tracks, where slight noise can be heard. Overall, it's a fantastic spot and even boasts a yolk on the nearby corner.",
    "I went in for a full set and requested long nails like the picture. Although my nails were cut short, I didn't mind. However, when I pointed out a crooked nail, I was told it hadn't been filed properly and acrylic was applied on it still crooked. The nail was eventually filed, but it kept getting shorter and shorter. Despite previous visits, this experience will be my last.",
    "Highly recommend going on a Tuesday for their 1/2 price tapas and $5 Sangria/margaritas. Fried Manchego, Hot Cauliflower, and Camarones were outstanding. Unique and flavorful experience overall!",
    "The live Jazz music at this place is simply amazing. With no alcohol or food distractions, it truly celebrates the soul of NOLA city culture. At $15, the tickets offer exceptional value.",
    "This mall offers a quiet and crowd-free shopping experience.",
    "After a long day at the convention center, we had dinner at H & I. We were seated in a quieter area and received attentive and professional service. The recommended aged ribeye steak was one of the best we've had, perfectly cooked medium rare. We split the 18-ounce steak and it was more than enough for both of us. The signature shrimp cocktail and iceberg lettuce wedge with crumbled bacon were also delicious. The only disappointment was the limited choice of medium-priced wines, which slowed down our selection process. Overall, I would rate H & I 4.5 stars if possible.",
    "This Italian restaurant was a huge disappointment. The service was slow and forgetful, the lemonade was too tart, and the garlic bread wasn't fresh. The stuffed shells and chicken parmesan were bland and poorly cooked. The only redeeming dish was the salmon. Overall, I regretted spending $50 here and would have preferred going to Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. I recommend trying Contessa for authentic Italian cuisine instead. Caruso, we won't be returning.",
    "Despite my initial hesitation, I was pleasantly surprised by this strip mall bar. My friend John, who works here, highly recommended it and I'm glad we gave it a chance. The food was delicious, especially looking forward to trying their pizza next time. Additionally, their newly added craft bar is impressive and the prices are quite reasonable.",
    "The Buffalo chicken salad was amazing! Fresh and crispy greens, delicious chicken, and a perfect blue cheese dressing. Will definitely be returning for this salad.",
    "I was highly impressed by the French-German dishes at Luke Restaurant in New Orleans. The historic vibe of the former Masonic Temple Building added to the overall experience. Although we initially faced a slight inconvenience due to the reservation policy, our server made up for it with excellent service. The cocktails were flavorful, the Crawfish Bisque had a sour aftertaste, the Luke Burger was outstanding, and the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp dish was loved by my friend. The Moules et Frites had bold flavors, and the Bread Pudding and Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee for dessert were delicious. Overall, it was a memorable dining experience.",
    "The dental clinic impressed with its TVs in the exam rooms, but it turns out they're more of a pricey perk than a useful distraction during dental work. The dental work done was of good quality, but the price was high and it's uncertain if it was truly necessary.",
    "Yesterday was my first visit to Paris Parker and I had a great experience! I usually rely on recommendations when choosing a stylist, but I needed to find someone quickly near my home. I was assigned to Stacey for a full highlight appointment and she did an amazing job. She eliminated all the brassy tones from my hair and made my blonde look natural and vibrant. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to go back multiple times to get the color right - Stacey nailed it on the first try. She was also a pleasure to talk to, which made the hours in the chair fly by. I highly recommend Stacey, although I might regret it if she gets too busy.",
    "I absolutely love the wide selection of ready-made teas at this place! While loose tea can be pricey, the option to mix my own concoction is worth it. The staff is incredibly friendly and always remembers my preferences. Perfect experience every time!",
    "GRI provided an exceptional experience in finding a one-of-a-kind engagement ring. From the knowledgeable and attentive staff to the custom design options, GRI exceeded our expectations. The final product was stunning and the overall experience was relaxed and pleasant. Highly recommended!",
    "Love this place for cocktails! Prices are a bit steep, but the unique glassware and designs are worth it. The Dragon's Tear and Blackmail are delicious, and my friends loved them too. Laid-back ambiance with great music and quirky decor. Not a fan of the food, but I'll be back for drinks.",
    "Pizzaville exceeded my expectations! The prices are a bit high, but the quality of the food is outstanding. The pizza had a perfect crust, with crunchy ends and a slightly chewy middle. The generous amount of mushrooms and extra sauce added to the deliciousness. The \"breadsticks\" were actually garlic bread strips, so buttery and garlicy that I couldn't stop myself from finishing the whole order. The employees were friendly and the store was clean. I can't wait to go back and try their lunch buffet.",
    "The service was good, staff polite, but the food lacked flavor. Drinks were average. Suitable for a quick lunch.",
    "I enjoyed the modern and cozy ambiance with appropriate lighting for dinner. The waiter seemed impatient and rushed, not fully focused on providing a great experience. The Shrimp Breaux Bridge and Balsamic Salmon were tasty, but not extraordinary. The Pesto Crusted Idaho Trout was well-cooked and flavored. The Zangria White lacked advertised fruits, which was disappointing. Despite the shortcomings, I would give the place another chance due to the positive reputation of the menu and hopeful better service.",
    "The burgers at this spin-off from Rouge are better than their flagship restaurants. The option to edit toppings on the placard is convenient, and the Kobe Beef burger is worth the extra cost. The brioche bun adds to the overall experience. The truffle oil fries are a must-try and being open late on weekends is a bonus.",
    "I recently tried this place and unfortunately, the pizza was quite disappointing. The previous establishment I visited had much better quality, offering delicious homemade food.",
    "Had an awesome lunch at this place. The jalapeno burger was fantastic and the patio had a great vibe. Will definitely return.",
    "Review:\nI highly recommend this hotel in Reno. It is absolutely stunning and I always choose to stay here when I visit. The Spa is fantastic, with friendly staff and clean pools. The rooms are clean and well-organized. The front desk staff is also very helpful and accommodating. There is a 24-hour diner on-site that serves good food, although it can be a bit pricey, as expected for a casino. The only downsides are the lack of bathroom fans causing a steamy shower experience and a missing creamer with room service coffee. Overall, it's a great hotel with amazing amenities.",
    "The tour was interesting, the beer was good, and the atmosphere was the best part. They have TVs for sports, board games, live music, and tours every hour. It can get busy, but everything flowed well. A great spot for a fun time with friends or a date.",
    "This place is absolutely awful. From the horrendous service and unappetizing food to the disgustingly dirty environment, I highly doubt I'll escape without getting food poisoning. Stay away.",
    "This wine and liquor store is my top choice in Nashville. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and won't judge you for asking about affordable options. The selection and prices are great, but be cautious when pulling in due to a high curb.",
    "I highly recommend Circle of Friends daycare. Linda and the staff have been incredibly helpful and my kids have thrived both emotionally and academically. The low turnover rate is a plus and my children have learned fascinating facts that even surprised me. Despite a few behavioral issues with other children, I am overall happy and content with this daycare.",
    "The new location on Central is fantastic! The staff is great, and the atmosphere is wonderful. They seem to have found a place where they will thrive.",
    "Location and service were great, creating an authentic Ethiopian dining experience. Unfortunately, the food fell short in terms of flavor and taste compared to other Ethiopian restaurants we've tried. Overall, it's a decent restaurant, but nothing exceptional. 6/10.",
    "First time here and not disappointed. Amazing seafood seasoning. Ordered oysters, $45 combo, and garlic chicken wings for family of six - more than enough for us. Only complaint is order mix-up.",
    "Ordered 1/2 chicken, rice, and plantains to go for lunch. Chicken was salty, only got 2 pieces of plantains, and paid $8. Disappointed. Will reconsider ordering from here again.",
    "Initially, the take-out Chinese restaurant was average, neither exceptional nor disappointing. However, upon a recent visit, they impressed us with flawless delivery and outstanding food. The rating has now improved to 5 stars.",
    "The Rib Cook-Off is a must-visit event! Taking the bus is convenient and affordable, and Great Basin's large beers are worth it. The JA Nugget mobile app helps you find vendors easily. Bring cash and explore non-rib vendors for great finds. Monday is less crowded, with cheap food deals after 5:00 pm.",
    "This restaurant offers excellent food and a bustling bar atmosphere. However, the service was slow and somewhat inattentive. The menu is partially in French, which may be confusing for non-French speakers or tourists. Overall, a good dining experience but not compelling enough to warrant a return visit.",
    "This place is a must-visit! I had the amazing chocolate chip pancakes and the line was manageable. However, the sausage side dish wasn't remarkable. The efficient payment system helps keep the line moving quickly. To avoid waiting, go early in the morning or around 7:15.",
    "The Sunday brunch buffet was incredibly satisfying with a wide variety of options, including seafood, omelet and pasta stations, custom sushi rolls, and delicious desserts. The bottomless mimosas were generously poured and led to a fun and tipsy experience. The a la carte menu offered additional savory dishes, and the cozy ambiance made up for the lack of a view. Despite the price, the indulgence is worth it if you enjoy overeating and overdrinking.",
    "Stopped in Santa Barbara for some fish tacos last Tuesday and tried the #2 ranked place for Baja fish tacos. Pleasantly surprised by how delicious they were. The kitchen accommodated our request for shrimp tacos on the side with a generous portion of battered shrimp. Sat outside on the veranda, enjoying the yummy food and lovely December weather. Friendly staff. Will definitely be back next time in town.",
    "Overall, On the Border in Mount Laurel offers delicious chips and salsa, good beer specials, and a variety of vegetarian sides. The cheese enchiladas are particularly tasty. Dining service is usually great, although the bartenders can be hit-or-miss. While some, like Joann, provide friendly and attentive service, others, like Nikki, offer poor service with long waits and unfriendly demeanor. Despite this inconsistency, the restaurant provides good appetizers, cold beer, reasonable prices, and generally satisfactory service.",
    "This place in St Louis is busy but worth a visit. I loved the amazing peach shake, and my friends enjoyed their food too. The wait was long on a hot day, and the ordering process was a bit confusing, but the prices were reasonable. Overall, it's a great stop if you're in the area.",
    "Delicious cakes, disappointing service. While the desserts were amazing, the service left much to be desired. Long wait time, inefficient packaging, and a barista who didn't understand how to make a simple iced coffee. The cakes were worth it, but the overall experience was not.",
    "The accommodations at the JW were outstanding. Nathan went above and beyond to provide a quiet and private space for me to pump. The facilities were impeccably clean and I was grateful for the kind and supportive staff. Kudos to JW for supporting working moms!",
    "Overall, Joe's offers tasty and reasonably priced food, particularly the beef tacos and meatloaf with mashed potatoes. The salad was also satisfying, with generous amounts of cheese. However, the service was disappointing on both nights, with waitresses lacking knowledge about menu items and being slow to attend to customers. The restaurant itself is visually appealing and the bathrooms are well-maintained. While the menu has a variety of well-crafted options, the inconsistent service from some of the servers prevents a five-star rating.",
    "The food is excellent with a long list of choices. The sandwiches have great meat and the hand-made toasted ravioli is some of the best in town. The people are welcoming.",
    "I recently tried this St. Louis BBQ joint after hearing all the buzz about it. The customer service was excellent, and their homemade BBQ sauce had a perfect balance of sweet, tangy, and spice. However, the pull pork sandwich, beans, and Cole slaw combo might be overwhelming for those unaccustomed to this type of cuisine or excessive intake.",
    "I was disappointed with the chicken salad sandwich as it only contained two small cubes of chicken with mayo. The \"salad\" accompanying it was simply a bowl of lettuce. This left me hungry and unsatisfied.",
    "Enjoyed a lovely brunch with consistently good food and efficient, courteous service. Sumptuous omelets, fun beverages, and a nice al fresco dining experience on the patio. Budget breakfast option was satisfying, but had to ask for fresh bacon as it had run out. Fish tacos also delicious.",
    "This place is amazing! Even before trying the pancakes, I was already sold. The long line out the front door speaks volumes about how awesome it is. I had a simple breakfast of hashbrowns, eggs, and bacon, but it was absolutely fabulous. The service was excellent too. I will definitely be returning for a sit-down meal. The only downside is that parking is a bit challenging, but that's expected.",
    "I recently ordered from C & B's through Order Up Delivery Svc and had a fantastic winter dinner experience at home. The Swanky Frank with fries was delicious, especially with the seasoned fries as an added touch. The beef chili, which I couldn't resist, came in a well-packaged large bowl and I plan on enjoying it as a late-night snack. The sour cream and crackers on the side were perfect for warming up. I highly recommend using Order Up for a cozy chili experience at home this winter!",
    "Great rich food but a bit pricey. Delicious and ever-changing menu. The most unique donuts around.",
    "The Carriage House Margarita with a brandy twist, all the empanadas, the delicious Red Drum fish dish, and the indulgent Churros are highly recommended at Livery. Don't miss out on these mouthwatering treats!",
    "My son and I were instantly satisfied with the efficient and friendly service at this busy burger place. We enjoyed delicious Highland stouts and a fresh garden salad as starters. The Black and Blue burger with regular fries was incredible, perfectly cooked with a balanced blue cheese flavor. The sweet potato fries were some of the best we've ever had. The burgers were devoured in blissful silence, a sure sign of their excellence. We'll definitely be back.",
    "The BEST donut place ever, wish they shipped their products. Miss it so much since I moved to Florida. Unfortunately, it's only in New Orleans. Sad face!",
    "Katie's is a classic neighborhood restaurant in New Orleans with a touch of Italian-American influence. Their meatballs are outstanding, and you'll encounter plenty of friendly and traditional locals dining early in the evening. Adjust your expectations, and you'll have a satisfying dining experience.",
    "Exceptional service! Quick, friendly, and highly professional staff. My definite choice for oil changes from now on.",
    "As a Latino, I strongly advise avoiding this place. The hairdresser I had was extremely rude and unprofessional.",
    "This place needs a serious makeover like on Restaurant Impossible. The run-down and tacky decor, along with the dark atmosphere, only try to hide its dingy state. We encountered sticky surfaces throughout. My burger, ordered medium, was instead a charred and flavorless hockey puck. The named baked crab soup turned out to be an accurate mispronunciation as it was far from good. Unfortunately, the crab stuffed mushrooms were underwhelming, lacking in crab. On a positive note, the servers were exceptionally friendly.",
    "I absolutely love this place! The owner is friendly, and the service is outstanding. The food here is ridiculously good, especially the huevo rancho and best sandwich. Don't miss out on the amazing grits as well. Make sure to say hi to the owner when you visit, he's wonderful.",
    "I had a perfect happy hour experience at this place! The oysters were absolutely delicious, and my friend and I enjoyed a couple of their fantastic cocktails. We tried the Riverbend and Champagne au Poir, both were tasty. The sides we ordered, fries and grits, were fantastic. In fact, these were the best grits I've ever had! The attentive and friendly server added to the overall amazing experience. I will definitely be returning.",
    "Bella Vista Designs is absolutely fabulous! Their professionalism, innovation, and affordability are unmatched. The team never fails to amaze with their can-do attitude and stunning design. The events I produce at the Santa Barbara Historical Museum and Goleta Valley Historical Society always impress generous donors, leaving them in awe. I am immensely grateful to Bella Vista Designs for their countless successful events and unforgettable moments.",
    "Excellent dental experience in Tucson!",
    "This place is highly overrated with subpar food and terrible service. My order was completely messed up and there were no apologies. With plenty of other options around State Street, I would strongly advise avoiding this place.",
    "I highly recommend this place! The food is excellent, the service is great, and the prices are reasonable. The falafel and beef gyro pita were delicious and fresh. The owner is very kind. The portions are generous and we even got complimentary baklava. This hidden gem in Manayunk deserves to succeed and I'll be referring all my friends. Overall, a unique and satisfying dining experience.",
    "Great food, excellent service! Only minor issue: our entrees arrived a bit too soon after the appetizers. Overall, a great experience.",
    "Overall, this place is mediocre with a lackluster atmosphere. The location is unimpressive, situated in a dirty strip mall alongside Mozzarella Pizza. The interior gives off a careless vibe, as it appears unkempt and falling apart. Although the food is passable and palatable, it is far from outstanding or amazing. While not necessarily a place to avoid, it certainly doesn't offer anything remarkable or exceptional to warrant a strong recommendation.",
    "Phenomenal place to eat! The Hickory burger was amazingly delicious. Definitely coming back for more!",
    "Food had great flavors, unique experience. Server Brian was a passionate foodie. Portions were small and didn't like the interior. Interesting place, but dishes too complicated for frequent visits. Chefs change menu yearly. Owners own successful Red Pony and two other nearby restaurants.",
    "The service at this place has significantly improved since my last visit. I received great service from a staff member named Dillon. The ambiance is casual, where you can simply order and sit while they bring the food to you. The food options are delicious and plentiful, although not fancy. What's great is that everything is very affordable, and a family of four can eat here for around $30, which is an excellent deal in today's pricey market. If you're seeking a quick and casual Asian dining experience, I highly recommend giving this place a try.",
    "Using the Yelp app significantly reduced wait times at this busy breakfast spot. The menu offers a wide variety of options, including delicious cinnamon French toast and a standout strawberry orange juice. While traditional breakfast foods were average, the extra menu options make for exciting future visits. The restaurant could benefit from better cooling, but the service was excellent. Having two payment options at the counter was a convenient touch.",
    "I recently visited Shaving Grace for a haircut and had a great experience. The atmosphere reminded me of my old Barber Shop in Philly: a big TV in the waiting area and a comfortable plush couch. The young lady who checked me in was very friendly and offered me a choice of water, soda, or even a beer. I opted for the latter and was pleased. The haircut itself was excellent, and I enjoyed the lively conversations among the guys discussing current events, sports, and local news. I've definitely found my new spot and will be returning.",
    "The food was excellent, especially the eggs Benedict. The toast was superb and the cream pancakes were the best I've ever tasted. The server, Tina, was awesome and the people here are genuinely nice. Stellar experience!",
    "The food was delicious, with my husband enjoying a cheese and bacon burger while I savored a well-made and flavorful crawfish sausage por bo. Great service overall.",
    "Had a great experience with JT at Ashley Furniture store! He was extremely helpful, especially when I needed to modify my order.",
    "Cucina Zapata at Drexel University offers delicious and unique food options that surpass the typical food truck experience. The graffiti-style truck stands out among the others in the row. I ordered the thai short rib tacos, which were fantastic despite the spicy hot sauce. They were far superior to taco bell. My girlfriend loved her cap'n crunch tilapia burrito. The food's visual appearance was appealing and left us excited to dig in. With great taste and reasonable prices, I highly recommend Cucina Zapata for a satisfying lunch. 5 stars.",
    "I recently had my first haircut at this salon with Jessie Becker. She skillfully removed my damaged ends and really listened to my requests. Jessie is incredibly sweet and also has a knack for working with kids. I highly recommend visiting this place and asking for her.",
    "This place is a gem! The ramen is excellent, and I'm thrilled to have discovered it. The service and food are exceptional.",
    "This place is undeniably adorable with friendly servers and delicious food. However, I was disappointed by the minuscule portion sizes. As a result, I left feeling unsatisfied. It's disheartening when even neighborly restaurants are stingy with their servings.",
    "Just ate here for the first time and the hype was real. Girlfriend had the Greek Salad, I had the Chickpea Vegetarian Pita with some substitutions. Food was on point, portions were filling and satisfying. Great staff and environment. Will definitely return!",
    "First time here and I was impressed! The bar and restaurant area is fantastic with an open floor plan and lots of TVs for sports viewing. Being attached to their O'Fallon brewery, you can expect great beer choices. Their House Special IPA was excellent, perfectly balanced and not overly bitter. The only drawback is the lack of desserts. Look out for Troy behind the bar! 4 stars.",
    "This neighbourhood dive bar on Whyte Avenue's east side is a lively spot with average decor, a younger crowd, and a couple of pool tables and a foosball table. The drinks are reasonably priced, and there are a few TV screens. The wings are always a good deal, and the servers are young and pleasant. The owner behind the bar is fine. I added an extra star because I felt the previous review was too critical.",
    "I was disappointed with this restaurant located near the Peppermill. It seemed to attract customers from nearby auto repair shops. The Chinese food served here was of low quality and they had trouble getting our order right. Even when we tried a simple dish, it tasted awful.",
    "Overall, despite a small issue with the Yelp coupon, the food at this restaurant was excellent. The chicken caeser salad was delicious and generously topped with chicken. The subs were fresh and flavorful. Additionally, they offer a variety of drink options, including beer and various flavors of Dr. Brown's cream soda. The location is conveniently close to the Wagon Wheel flea market, making it a nice spot to visit.",
    "I highly recommend Dr. Neel and Robin at this optometrist. They were exceptionally helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. They patiently answered all my questions, assisted with frame selection, and fitted me for contact lenses. Best optometrist I've seen.",
    "Absolutely amazing breakfast with huge pancakes and simple, yet delicious home fries. The owner is incredibly kind and generous. Definitely my new favorite spot.",
    "We had a delightful stay at this beautiful and charming hotel during our family trip to the Big Easy. The staff, from the doorman to the wait staff for brunch, were incredibly friendly and helpful. The Carousel Bar is a must-visit. With its great location, we will definitely be returning next time we're in New Orleans.",
    "The chicken stew was disappointingly tasteless and seemed like leftover fried chicken thrown together in a pot. It left me feeling nauseous, making me regret my choice. Overall, a gross experience.",
    "Wei Hong was a disappointment. Although the takeout service was fast, the empty dining room should have been a warning sign. The steamed dumplings had potential but were ruined by a thick, doughy wrapper. The beef dishes had strange textures and off flavors, prompting us to throw them out. The sauces were gloopy and the fried rice was just average. Overall, we won't be returning to this Chinese restaurant in St Louis.",
    "Cecile was extremely helpful in assisting us with loading plywood ahead of IRMA. Many thanks!",
    "Overall, the food at this restaurant was exceptional. The chicken tagine was cooked to perfection, with succulent and tender meat that easily fell off the bone. The carrot salad was an excellent accompaniment, subtly flavored with refreshing mint and cumin. The service was satisfactory, and the restaurant's cheerful and well-lit interior added to the pleasant dining experience. With a reasonable total cost of around $13, this place is definitely worth a visit.",
    "We were excited to try this place based on positive reviews, but the food was extremely disappointing. The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed, hush puppies were flavorless, and undercooked chicken wings were barely warm. Only redeeming item was the chicken and biscuits, but biscuit was cold in spots. Nice atmosphere and friendly service, but subpar food means we won't be coming back.",
    "I had a frustrating experience ordering online, only to arrive and be told they had no record of my order. Extremely disappointing.",
    "If you haven't tried their cream filled donuts, you're missing out on life! These incredible treats made me drive all the way back to get a half dozen for the journey back to Michigan. I devoured every single one without any regrets. Pure heaven!",
    "I strongly advise avoiding Joe Bob's as it seems to prioritize over-serving and catering to gamblers. The kitchen has mold issues and an unpleasant smell, while the staff is only friendly towards big-spending gamblers. Instead, go to El Pollo Loco across the street for cleaner facilities and friendlier staff.",
    "We decided to try this place after Terakawa had a long line, and we are glad we did. The service was excellent, and the staff was friendly. The waitress even helped my wife with her jacket while she was holding our baby. The Chicken Katsu Curry Ramen, Shrimp Katsu Ramen, and Shoyu Ramen were all delicious. The curry soup was flavorful, and the fried chicken and shrimp were cooked perfectly. We also enjoyed the pork buns, although they were not like traditional pork buns. Overall, we had a fantastic experience.",
    "Brew D Licious has the best coffee in town. The owner is knowledgeable and knows how to keep customers coming back. The coffee is always fresh, and even delivered during construction. Excited for the new location to escape the hotel's bad smell. Brigitte has shown St. Petersburg what real coffee tastes and smells like!",
    "I recently tried the pizza and knots at this beach location and I must say, it was fantastic! The spot had a great street presence and the staff really knew their stuff.",
    "I always eat their oysters and they are absolutely amazing! Despite not knowing the type, they are the freshest and most delicious oysters I've had. Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed!",
    "The food was excellent, the best in the area. Kung pao beef, basil shrimp, and pork fried rice were all very good. Fast delivery too.",
    "The deli offers delicious and affordable sandwiches, such as the Philly and club. Our total bill, which included four bags of chips and two sandwiches, came to just over $20. The portions are large, so make sure to come with a big appetite.",
    "I highly recommend this place for dry cleaning and alterations. Despite some unfounded negativity, they are extremely competent and efficient. They even successfully removed decade old stains! Their average turnaround time is impressive, even during busy seasons. The staff may not be overly friendly, but I value their competence over friendliness. We'll definitely continue using their services even after we move.",
    "The new location is larger and offers street parking. The server was friendly and helpful with her recommendations. The Groothie was too sweet for my taste, but I enjoyed the flavorful Udon Noodle Salad.",
    "Just had an amazing experience at this restaurant! Bailey provided exceptional service, being friendly and attentive throughout our visit. The food was absolutely incredible - the hummus plate, pretzels, mozzarella sticks, and caprese salad were all fresh and delicious. The generous portion sizes amazed us. It was our first time here, but we are already planning to come back!",
    "Overall, despite the great entrees and reasonable prices, the lackluster service and attitude at this Fazoli's location really brought down the experience. The breadsticks, which are advertised as unlimited, caused a hassle when requesting more for our table. Additionally, there were issues with ordering, as a new employee struggled to take orders accurately during a busy lunch rush. If these issues are addressed, it could be a good option for a quick meal.",
    "I tried the $12 tchoup wash at this car wash. Despite a short wait and entertaining waiting area, the results were okay. Some dirt and bird poop were still visible. While better than no wash, I miss my favorite car wash that offers more thorough cleaning for $14. This place is 85% as expensive as LA but only 66.67% the quality. Next time, I'll try a touchless system for similar results without the entertainment.",
    "The large turtle tank has been replaced with a vibrant fish aquarium, with no information about the turtle's whereabouts. However, I still highly recommend it.",
    "This Starbucks is efficient with a fast-moving drive-thru and ample seating both indoors and outdoors. Overall, a great place.",
    "I requested a scissor cut for my straight hair, but the stylist ignored my preference and used clippers instead. Despite my clear instructions, she proceeded to cut 90% of my hair with clippers. I strongly advise going elsewhere for a haircut if you do not want a high and tight fade with clippers.",
    "I had an amazing lunch at this restaurant in NOLA. The food, ambiance, and location were all excellent. The artichoke and crab salad was absolutely delicious, making my mouth water just thinking about it. My friend enjoyed the grilled and roasted vegetable platter, which was also outstanding. Highly recommend!",
    "Fantastic lunch spot! A unique and funky atmosphere at Nashville airport. The food options are both delicious and healthy, and I highly recommend trying the sweet potato casserole with coconut and dried cranberry.",
    "This smaller intimate venue in Orlando always brings us back. The staff is excellent and the service is top-notch. If you manage to secure a table, don't forget to request #4!",
    "This place is a hidden gem! The food is consistently amazing, and the atmosphere is just right. The service is top-notch too. Although it can be a bit pricey, the Belgian Waffle topped with Nutella is worth every penny. A must-try for anyone who loves Nutella!",
    "Overall, this restaurant is a great choice for a late weekend brunch when the morning rush dies down. The wait times are usually short, but the seating system could use improvement. The dishes vary in quality, with some being just okay and others being awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are bland, but the club sandwich and egg/omelette platters are well-executed and tasty. The waffle stands out as the best item on the menu, being sweet, crispy, and delicious. The service is generally attentive, and the restaurant and bathrooms are clean. This place offers good value for the price.",
    "Overall, I had a good experience at this place, but was disappointed by their Reuben sandwich. On the other hand, my fiancee's sandwich with chicken, bacon, and avocado was amazing. I also enjoyed their spice chicken soup with corn bread. The chai latte was not impressive, so I would not recommend it. The prices are a bit high, but the atmosphere is great for a wonderful breakfast or lunch and the staff is friendly. Give it a try and share your thoughts!",
    "Target is a great alternative to Walmart, offering a wide range of products from clothes to electronics. Their affordable makeup and well-stocked grocery section make it a convenient shopping destination. Quick checkout process with ample open registers is another plus.",
    "I highly recommend the Oyster Bar, especially if you're lucky enough to be served by Kentrelle. The \"firecracker\" dish will leave you amazed.",
    "This HMV location offers the largest selection of gifts and titles in the city, with the option to order items not in stock. However, the staff may not always notify customers when their orders arrive. The staff at the tills are efficient and do not push for sign-ups to the pure rewards program, which has lackluster redemption items. Overall, the selection and speedy service earn five stars, but pricing and slow ordering process bring the rating down to three. Recommended for finding specific movies or CDs.",
    "Incredible experience! Must try the friend oysters. We also had the crawfish bisque and shrimp with grits, all were delicious. Remember to make a reservation.",
    "I was on a coat-quest for the Holidays. Found the perfect coat at Burlington but it wasn't in my size. Bought a coat from Target but it wasn't what I wanted. Finally, at Ross, I found a beautiful pleather bomber jacket but it got wrinkled. Went back to Ross, spoke to the manager, and miraculously found my dream coat in my size. Thank you, Ross! Forever my go-to store!",
    "This place is a winner! The Udon Noodle Salad is absolutely amazing and the Crispy Hipcity Ranch is so, so good. The staff is friendly, service is fast, and they even offer delivery. Highly recommended!",
    "Philadelphia, I love you! This place has amazing wood-fired pizzas with charred crusts, just the way I like it. The Marinara is simple yet delicious, and they even have a cheeseless option for my son. The Salsiccia with roasted fennel is brilliant and we couldn't resist the Rotolo with mortadella and pistachio pesto. The cocktails, especially The Brooklyn, are to die for. We ended our meal with perfect Italian cookies and an Affogato. I'm in heaven here. Great service and 5 stars all around! Can't wait to try Vetri's other restaurants.",
    "This high-end store in West Edmonton Mall offers great clothes and excellent service. The friendly and non-pushy staff cater to your needs without being overbearing. While they carry casual clothing, their specialty lies in suits, dress shirts, and fancy attire. Although it may be pricey, the quality and overall shopping experience make it worth it.",
    "Overall, the food at this Mediterranean food truck is tasty but not outstanding. It's a great late-night spot, perfect for satisfying late-night cravings. The portion size for the price could be improved, but it's fair enough. The restaurant has ample seating and provides a nice break from the nearby bar/club scenes. The place is clean, and the servers are quick and friendly. The dimly lit atmosphere and eclectic decoration may seem strange, but it adds to the unique charm of the place. Despite its quirks, I would definitely return.",
    "I love this shop! The staff is friendly and always helpful with suggestions. The bait is top-notch and they have a great selection of tackle at unbeatable prices. I regret not shopping here sooner and now it's my go-to store for all my fishing needs. My only complaint is that there aren't more of these shops in town!",
    "Nigel is amazing and his candy is worth the drive! My friends can't get enough of his delicious Bon bons.",
    "Muriel's is a must-visit restaurant in the French Quarter offering a fantastic lunch special. The Bloody Mary was flavorful and reasonably priced, and the wait time was manageable with the convenient text message system. Although the servers were a bit forgetful, the overall experience was still enjoyable. The turtle soup was outstanding, and the generous portion of pork chop with red beans left me satisfied until bedtime. The historic location and ambiance added to the dining experience, making it worth a visit when in the Quarter.",
    "Stopped here on our shuttle driver's recommendation. The red velvet ice cream is amazing! Cake pieces, creamy goodness\u2014yum!",
    "First time visit, friendly service, waived minimum credit order. Average American-Chinese food, some greasy sauces. Good vegetarian options. Lunch specials with rice and drink/soup/egg roll for $5.75. Overall, decent but not exceptional.",
    "Delicious pizza with a unique cornmeal crust. The bianco salad was okay, but lacked excitement. Wish they took reservations and were slightly more affordable. Overall, worth a visit if you're in the area.",
    "Indy Reads is an essential downtown bookstore. It not only provides a place to browse, connect with fellow book lovers, and enjoy book readings but also supports adult literacy. With a vast collection of both used and new books, you'll likely find hidden gems you didn't even know you wanted. Although the $1 children's books can be a bit challenging to browse due to tight arrangements, the overall pricing and space are excellent. Don't miss out on this wonderful bookstore!",
    "I wish I had checked Yelp before coming here. Went in to have my right passenger front wheel checked due to tire pressure and noticed a lifted piece of tire. Was told there would be a couple of hours wait and that appointments are not accepted. Staff member was rude and lacked customer service skills. Ended up going to Mr. Tire down the street and got a new tire replaced in 30 minutes. They seemed much busier and more efficient.",
    "Outstanding experience! As a florist myself, I have high standards when sending flowers, but this shop exceeded my expectations! I gave them freedom within a budget and asked for a bright and cheery arrangement. They absolutely nailed it and delivered promptly. Many thanks!",
    "I gave this place one star because it was terrible. The service was bad and the food was even worse. The queso fundido was strange and the salsa was a mushy mess. It took forever to get our food and when it finally arrived, it was disappointing. The only good thing was the chips. I ordered beans and rice but got white rice with refried beans instead. Don't waste your time here, even Taco Bell serves better food than this. The service was equally terrible.",
    "I highly recommend this small coffee place owned by the lovely, blond and friendly Karyn! Their coffee is fantastic and they even offer the convenience of a drive-through.",
    "Ed's is a massive entertainment venue with a variety of activities and spaces, including restaurants, bars, video games, and more. It's great for young kids and birthday parties. They also host live bands, featuring lesser-known but interesting musicians who can attract a decent crowd. Overall, Ed's is a fun and affordable place to enjoy endless entertainment in E-town.",
    "Although the rave reviews are difficult for me to comprehend, the wonderful conversation and company during my dining experience made up for it.",
    "I am extremely disappointed that they have discontinued their salad and pizza bar. I used to visit frequently, but after moving away, I thought they had closed down. When I discovered their relocation, I was excited to have their delicious salad again. However, they now only serve whole pizzas, which is not what I was hoping for. Overall, a big letdown.",
    "Poblano's used to serve a delicious Amiga bowl with shredded grilled chicken, rice, grilled onions and peppers, and queso sauce. However, on my recent visit, they substituted the chicken and rice with chicken crisps, which lacked moisture and quantity. When I voiced my discontent, the manager argued that this was the same dish they had been serving for years. Additionally, their soft tacos were stale and lacked flavor. It was disappointing that their cook had quit that night, resulting in a subpar experience. Sadly, Poblano's received a negative rating from me.",
    "I like Dewey's primary location for its proximity to my house. The pizza's appearance and crust are great. However, my main issue with Dewey's is its excessive saltiness. The pepperoni, Socrates Revenge, and Bronx Bomber pizzas felt like eating a brick of salt. The overwhelming combination of salty sauce and meat leaves my taste buds unable to detect any other flavor. If they address this issue, I would love Dewey's. The salads are decent in size but seem like something easily put together at home. I usually avoid ordering them due to the cost.",
    "Overall, the service was excellent and the chocolate cake for dessert was amazing. However, the disappointment came from the food, which was not up to expectations. The egg drop soup was hot, but the rest of the dishes were served at room temperature. The shrimp with candied walnuts was overly sweet and didn't complement the bland brown rice. Despite being accommodating to food allergies, PF Changs failed to impress.",
    "Overall, the food at this BBQ joint was a mixed bag. The Mac n cheese was absolutely delicious and worth indulging in. While the ribs had great flavor, they were disappointingly tough. The pulled pork was sweet and enjoyable. The baked beans were passable, but the cole slaw had a strange aftertaste reminiscent of lake water. The unique ambiance of dining in an abandoned car wash adds a special element to the experience and is worth giving it a try.",
    "The fries are amazing and worth thinking about, but the beef kebob sandwich was disappointing with a lack of meat and too many onions. Considering giving it a second chance. The smoothies tasted like syrup and ice. Fair prices and great service. Love the cozy mom and pop atmosphere of the restaurant.",
    "Love this new taqueria! The green sauce is amazing, especially on cheese enchiladas. The Mexican rice is top-notch too. Authentic Mexican food that reminds me of my favorite spots in Houston. It's the only place in New Orleans East for Mexican cuisine. I'll definitely be a regular customer. Open 7 days a week, serving breakfast and open late. Call 504-242-0573 for takeout. YUMMY!",
    "I was disappointed with the portion size of the Mexican Roll and Philadelphia Roll. The taste was nothing special and overall bland.",
    "I love browsing in this trendy shopping area near Mass Ave. Silver in the City is my first choice for unique home and style items. They even allow dogs inside, which is a huge plus for me. The only downside is that the employees tend to watch you closely, which limits privacy while browsing and deciding on purchases.",
    "I had a great takeout experience at this restaurant near closing time. The puttanesca I ordered was delicious, with a perfect balance of saltiness and spiciness. I appreciated the diverse menu options and the ability to customize my own dish. The only downside was the lack of a gluten-free dough option, which might cause some discomfort later on.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the food, particularly the crab cake Benedict, which was delicious! The service was excellent and they also offered a great selection of smoothies.",
    "I had a must-have breakfast in New Orleans at a restaurant with a diner style atmosphere. The service was quick and our server was great. The Grits and Grillades, slow roasted beef with peppers and onions in a brown gravy over creamy Gouda cheese grits, was absolutely delicious. It exceeded my homemade version and will be a must-try again on future trips to New Orleans.",
    "This business is extremely unhelpful, unresponsive, and dishonest. They provided misleading information about a specific unit, failed to communicate effectively, and did not honor the price discussed. It is evident that they prioritize money over tenant satisfaction. I regret wasting my time and money with them.",
    "Sierra and India from JOTSB provided exceptional care for my family during our recent reunion in Santa Barbara. They went above and beyond by not only purchasing all the necessary items in advance but also anticipating our needs and restocking drinks and food throughout the event. Their flexibility, enthusiasm, attention to detail, and overall fabulous service made the experience truly memorable. I highly recommend JOTSB and hope to have the opportunity to use their services again in the future.",
    "This spot fell short of expectations. Despite handwritten signs and limited bagel options, the food was average at best. The pastrami, egg, and cheese sandwich lacked pastrami and had unmelted cheese. Moreover, my wife had the unfortunate experience of spoiled creamer in her coffee. We'll be sticking with Einstein's or St Pete Bagel instead.",
    "This Italian restaurant has very friendly employees and offers reasonably priced dishes. The homemade salad dressing is excellent and the overall food quality is good. A great choice for Italian cuisine.",
    "I absolutely love their breakfast burritos! The bacon, egg, cheese, and potatoes combination is delicious. The well-seasoned and perfectly cut small potatoes prevent the burrito from being overwhelmed by mushy potatoes. The flavors of eggs, bacon, and potatoes shine through. I would prefer a little more cheese, but it's a minor issue. The salsa bar offers a nice variety, and the friendly staff adds to the welcoming atmosphere. I feel fortunate to have them just a mile away from my house. Hoping they stick around for years to come!",
    "As a new resident in Tucson, I've explored multiple pizza joints near U of A, and this one is undoubtedly the best. In fact, it surpasses any pizza I've ever had, outranking even the renowned spots in NYC. The crust is simply enchanting, and their five alarm pizza delivers the perfect level of spiciness for the heat-lovers. Give it a shot, and disappointment is unlikely.",
    "I finally tried Honey's on my birthday and it was worth the wait! The food, including the french toast, home fries, sausage, and Jewish apple cake, was absolutely delicious. I'll definitely be coming back for more.",
    "Tria's knowledgeable staff and extensive beer and wine selection make it a must-visit. The outside seating is a delightful treat, although it can be hard to snag a table. The bustling atmosphere adds to its charm. While the food remains unexplored, the real highlight here lies in their exceptional drink options.",
    "Mae's is by far the best Chinese restaurant on the east side. From the pleasant atmosphere and beautiful decor to the fresh and delicious food, this place surpasses all expectations. The impeccable service and friendly staff add to the enjoyable dining experience. Not to mention, Mae's offers incredible value for money, especially their lunch specials. Don't miss out on trying Mae's, you will not be disappointed.",
    "This place is a Tucson gem and my absolute favorite! The flavors are amazing; they taste even better than you imagine. My personal favorites include strawberries & champagne, toasted marshmallow, and cheesecake. I was thrilled when they opened locations in the valley after I moved to Phoenix. I will definitely keep visiting over and over!",
    "This location has significantly declined over the past few years. On a recent Saturday evening, only two staff members were working while most tables were occupied, resulting in long waiting times to order and pay. Unfortunately, the sandwich I received was made with hard, burnt bread that was barely edible. This establishment must either improve its quality or consider closing its doors.",
    "The cemetery is loved by some for its angel photo opportunities, but I find it a little creepy. On the bright side, it's peaceful, lacking zombies, and even had witches adding some photobombs. Overall, it's well-maintained with impressive gravestones and angels. And did I mention, no zombies?",
    "I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Port Richey and had a mediocre experience. The staff were friendly and helpful, and there was free wifi. The breakfast options were good. However, the beds were too soft and uncomfortable, and the a/c controls were unreliable. It was just okay, and I prefer the Hyatt hotels.",
    "The staff lacked customer service and seemed more interested in personal distractions. The food was mediocre, but not terrible. Overall, I would rate them slightly higher than 1.5.",
    "The food is excellent, but the customer service has declined and the portion sizes have significantly decreased over time. Even after providing feedback, my concerns were dismissed, leading to a negative experience. As a result, I will not be returning to this establishment.",
    "The food was excellent, with a wide variety of options. The staff was friendly and helpful in recommending dishes. Happy Hour is worth it, and the house margaritas stood out compared to other places. The chicken poblano was delicious, and my friend loved the ability to have three types of enchiladas on one plate.",
    "Highly recommend the salted caramel chocolate cake - the best we've ever tasted! The Apple Brown Betty was also awesome. Impressive beer selection.",
    "Great bar for college students. Affordable drinks and they have projectors to watch games. Only drawback is the screen should be wider to avoid the picture going off into the wall. Spacious during the day, probably gets crowded at night.",
    "I had a terrible experience with this restaurant. I called in an order for a half sausage, half cheese pizza and the staff seemed to have no idea what I was saying. I had to constantly repeat myself and even had my boyfriend call back to confirm our order. Despite this, they still got it wrong and gave us an all sausage pizza instead. This is the second time in a month that I have received terrible service from them. I also had a previous incident where they forgot to put my order in when I arrived for pickup. Overall, it was a terrible experience.",
    "Awful experience at Marmont Steakhouse. Cold soup, tasteless calamari, and wrong entree. Waiters argued with us about the mistake and caused illness from beef ravioli. Unapologetic staff. Avoid this place.",
    "Tako is the best place for sushi. Fresh and delicious, with private rooms for a fun night out. Must-try dishes like jalape\u00f1o yellowtail, kani salad, bird's nest roll, and naruto. Ordering is a breeze, and prices are reasonable - rarely spend over $35. Highly recommend Tako!",
    "The local ice cream is top-notch with flavors like Expresso Chip, Moose Tracks, and Graham Slam, all uniquely crafted and delicious.",
    "We have been loyal customers at this car wash for years and have no complaints. Wednesdays are great for ladies as they offer a discount on all wash options. The $5 car wash is not hand-wash, but it's perfect for a quick bath. They occasionally run a 2 for 1 special on auto detail packages, which we always take advantage of because they consistently deliver great results.",
    "This place is mediocre overall. The food is average, neither impressive nor terrible. The service can be hit or miss, depending on luck. Tried the drunken noodles and Thai green curry, but both were just average.",
    "Redemption at an old church is an extraordinary dining experience. The beautiful setting adds to the charm, especially for architecture enthusiasts. The service was impeccable, providing a fun time for our group. The paneed smoked soft shell crab was heavenly, and the seafood stuffed filet of fish was superb, enhancing the flounder's flavors. This meal ranks among the top 10 in my life. If you haven't been, you must try it!",
    "I love this place! Conveniently located near my home, I visit every other week. They regularly change flavors and have hidden toppings. The intense EDM music playing adds to the unique experience. Awesome!",
    "Incredible experience! The Steak Tartare was the best I've ever had and the Caribbean Seafood Pepper Pot and Curried Goat were absolutely wonderful. The unique combination of sweet curry and gnocchi in the goat dish was a pleasant surprise. Even with just a bite, the lime cheesecake was top notch. With no drinks due to post-Mardi Gras recovery, the service still stood out as exceptional. Great place, highly recommend!",
    "I went to this place on a Wednesday night. Despite being quiet, all tables were reserved except for the tall ones in the bar area. The location is not appealing, but the interior is stylish and masculine. The staff was knowledgeable and attentive, and the menu was intriguing. We ordered 3 small plates and a side dish, which was a bit too much for two people. The food was varied and unique, with reasonable prices. The smoked trout and venison hot dogs were fantastic, while the mini monte cristos were underwhelming. Overall, we paid $52.05 for the meal and left satisfied.",
    "I had an amazing experience at this frozen yogurt place on South Street. The flavors were all delicious, even the fat-free options felt indulgent. Highly recommended if you're looking for a sweet treat while out and about.",
    "I was impressed with the staff at this restaurant. Despite demanding customers and ridiculous complaints, our server, a small girl with purple hair, carried multiple plates, explained the menu flawlessly, and handled everything like a true professional. Thumbs up and five stars to the staff. As for the customers, they need to learn basic manners or stay home.",
    "I had a positive shopping experience at Hallmark despite not making a purchase. Their prices were fair, warranties and certifications were impressive, and the staff was friendly and not pushy. If I hadn't found a different car, I would have likely bought from them. Recommended for local buyers.",
    "The white meat fried chicken was slimy and salty, while the sides (Mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes) were cold and flavorless. The service was strange, as the server laughed awkwardly during our order, making us feel uncomfortable. Won't return.",
    "Fantastic lobster rolls, both warm and cold. The bread was fantastic too! Though slightly pricey, the quality of the food made it worth it.",
    "The Habit Burger is a fantastic burger joint that stands toe-to-toe with In-N-Out. I had the double char and choco shake at the Goleta location, and as always, it was delicious. Don't miss out on their excellent onion rings too.",
    "My husband and I have been regulars at this place for the past 8 years. The food is amazing, prepared quickly, and they offer fantastic drink specials.",
    "This is a typical Broad Ripple charming spot with a small, trendy, and bustling atmosphere. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations, which can be annoying for those traveling from another part of town. However, the cocktails were creative and delicious, and the server's suggestions were on point. The guacamole was tasty, but came with nuts despite requesting them to be left off. The Harvest salad was a highlight with its delightful combination of fruit and root vegetables. The Veracruz Trigger fish and Serrano Scallops were both delicious, accompanied by interesting white sweet mashed potatoes. The Tostones were a bit dry, but dipped in the Stewed Black Beans, they tasted great. Unfortunately, there were no gluten-free, dairy-free dessert options available. Overall, it's worth a visit, just make sure to arrive before 7 pm on a Friday to secure a table.",
    "I've been to Jackson's multiple times and finally decided to leave a review. The panini Reuben was delicious with great use of garlic and perfectly sliced meat. However, the salad came out at the same time as the sandwich, which was not ideal, and the presentation was a bit sloppy. The sandwich was served directly on a plate instead of a napkin, causing the bread to get soggy if it sits for too long. The price is a bit high, but the food and drink quality justifies it. They have a great selection of wines and beers to choose from. The wait staff is generally friendly but can sometimes be short or distracted. The wait time for drinks can vary, with my longest wait being 15 minutes during a lunch rush. Overall, it was a good experience and I will return.",
    "Overall, I had a positive experience with Young who did my pedicure. She was friendly, had a positive attitude, and provided thorough massaging. However, I was disappointed with the gel manicure done by the owner. The old gel polish was not fully removed, the polish application was uneven with noticeable bumps, and the sides of my nails were not fully covered. This experience has made me reconsider returning to the salon.",
    "I tried their amazing trio appetizer and the pizza was equally delicious. Overall, highly recommended.",
    "Hidden gem on the Westside with great food at a reasonable price. Must try the Indian taco and sweet fry bread. Daily specials like $1 tacos on Tuesdays and Fridays. I'm a regular, eating here at least once a week. Highly recommend.",
    "The bakery not only offers delightful cookies, cupcakes, and puddings but also exceptional salted caramel cakes. The four-layered moist cake with caramel buttercream was truly amazing. I ensured the icing was made with real ingredients and it did not disappoint - the rich taste of butter and sugar was evident. The cake was both elegant and delicious, a rare combination.",
    "Highly recommend skipping fancy desserts for a stroll around Broadway to visit this place. Their homemade ice cream, especially Cake Mix, is absolutely delicious. Perfect spot to end a date.",
    "I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a sushi place and it was a game-changer. I used to overlook it for fast food chains, but no more. I had the delicious sushiya roll and it exceeded my expectations. The salmon was incredibly fresh and the miso soup was just perfect. I highly recommend this spot, it deserves a perfect 10/10 rating.",
    "The best Thai food in the area! Wish I lived closer. Red curry, pad thai, and chicken satay with peanut sauce are amazing! Great lunch specials.",
    "I took my family and daughter to this place for the first time. There were plenty of activities for my daughter and she loved it! However, I can only give it 2 stars because it was filthy. Despite the high admission price, the cleanliness was lacking. Staff didn't clean anything, electrical cords were exposed, and dust was everywhere. I hope management addresses these issues.",
    "Had a great experience as a walk-in at this clean location with friendly staff. Tammy did an amazing job on my eyebrows, and as a first-time guest, the service was free. They offer fantastic packages for various waxing services. Will definitely be returning!",
    "Extremely disappointed with this restaurant. Sushi was poorly cut, rice lacked flavor, and the dynamite was overly salty with excessive mayo. Left most of the food untouched. Avoid this place at all costs.",
    "Terrible service, had to order from the front counter after waiting for 30 minutes. Lazy waitresses prioritizing socializing over attending to customers. Advised another family to order takeout instead of dining in. Avoid this place and opt for delivery instead.",
    "This place is hands down the best Caribbean food in town. The dishes were fresh, perfectly cooked, and not heavy. The stewed chicken and curried chicken were both excellent, and the plantains were the best I've ever had. The owner was attentive and made sure we were satisfied. Amazing prices and a BYOB policy make it even better. I will definitely return and recommend it to everyone. Trust the 5-star reviews, they're real.",
    "Momo's is a cool and upbeat place, great for groups or first dates. The tapas plates were delicious, especially the scallops. Portions were generous but ordering two at a time is recommended. The Greek salad's dressing was too sweet. The Spanish granacha wine was excellent and reasonably priced. The belly dancer was cute but the experience felt a bit awkward. Despite better Greek food options in town, Momo's is the go-to place for a fun night out. We'll definitely return.",
    "I used to love this store in high school, but the service has gone downhill. The staff is stuck up, and one girl even scolded me for holding a book incorrectly. I haven't been back in three years and don't plan to return anytime soon.",
    "Standing in line and squeezing onto a wooden bench with strangers may not sound appealing, and the lack of heating or air conditioning may not be ideal, but trust me, it's worth it. The jazz show is incredibly fun and the venue itself is cool and legendary. Give it a try at least once, and I'm willing to bet that you'll keep coming back for more.",
    "Not worth the $5 fee. Confusing layout, boring self-guided tour. Save your money; visit the courthouse instead.",
    "Simply the best! Don't miss out on this gem in St Louis, MO. The frozen custard here is unparalleled and will exceed all your expectations.",
    "The ambiance wasn't up to par, but the service was nice and the food was decent. Might go back if I'm in the area and in the mood for sushi.",
    "The food at this place was simply outstanding! We sampled a variety of dishes including the crawfish beignet, seafood stuffed mushrooms, crab cakes, crab cake po boy, and seafood flatbread. Every single item was absolutely scrumptious.",
    "This DQ lacks quality and is not recommended. The staff seems inexperienced and it's best to look for another location.",
    "My husband and I love supporting local businesses when we travel to keep the real economy thriving. This shop offers a variety of locally made goods, from clothes to artwork and food items. The owner is friendly and we had a great experience. We highly recommend checking it out, we found unique items like a dragonfly wall sculpture and space age pens.",
    "I am incredibly impressed with this coffee shop in Reno. As coffee enthusiasts from Sacramento, my husband and I expected nothing but excellence, and we found it here. This place is an absolute gem that we wish existed back in Sac. It has become our go-to coffee shop, without a doubt. Their Matcha lattes are simply amazing. Sigh.",
    "I recently moved to Idaho and had an amazing experience at Chipotle. Taylor, one of the staff members, comped one of my meals, making my week and day. Her exceptional customer service and friendly nature stood out among the rest. Taylor is absolutely awesome!",
    "This place is a martinis lover's paradise, offering an extensive selection of about 500 martinis. Don't miss out on their amazing giant pitchers of Petron Pomegranate Margaritas. Prices are fair, service is excellent, but be patient as the staff can be overwhelmed with their busy schedule. Don't hesitate to visit!",
    "Claudio's is the go-to place for any Italian food products. Their old-school, family-oriented atmosphere is worth standing in line for. They have exceptional cheeses and a deep knowledge of food. They are eager to help and so are the other customers. Hanging at Claudio's makes you want to be Italian. It's not just shopping, it's an experience everyone should have.",
    "This hotel was terrible due to four main factors. Firstly, the prices were exorbitantly high, including charges for shuttle rides and overpriced amenities. Secondly, the service was extremely poor, with long hold times, wait times at the front desk, and unhelpful staff. Thirdly, despite being labeled as a resort, it was actually a loud convention hotel with constant noise and thin walls. Lastly, the hotel was excessively large, causing difficulties in finding one's way around and limited dining options. Overall, I'm relieved I attended a convention rather than paying for this disappointing hotel myself.",
    "I had high hopes for this place, but I was ultimately disappointed. The Dan Dan noodles were flavorful but lacked protein. The scallion pancakes were mediocre compared to another place I recently tried. The Wontons in Chilli oil were extremely spicy and lacked substance. The Talapia Medallions were fried well, but the greens were difficult to chew. The service and atmosphere were good, but I won't be going out of my way to eat here again. It feels too commercialized and Americanized for my taste. I prefer authentic Cantonese-style and hole-in-the-wall places.",
    "This review highlights the frustration and disappointment the reviewer experienced with their stay at Hyatt. Despite clearly stating their request for a \"feather free\" room multiple times, feathers were still present in their assigned room. The reviewer questions whether Hyatt will ever grasp the importance of this issue, potentially risking another emergency room visit. Additionally, the high nightly parking fee of $29 in St. Louis is regarded as absurd. The repeated apology from the staff becomes tiresome for the reviewer.",
    "Visited this place on a busy weekend, had to wait over an hour - not worth it. Came back earlier and had a great experience. Pancakes are amazing, especially the butter pecan. They also offer turkey sausage and bacon. Highly recommend going early and wearing loose pants.",
    "The food was average, disappointing for fried green tomato experts. Meatloaf was good but the sides were just average. Entertainment was also disappointing with limited songs played per hour.",
    "Tina provided excellent service with quick attention, even on a Sunday morning. The wait time was minimal, approximately 15 minutes. The standout dish was the huevos bruncheros, an absolute must-try. It's hard to put into words how delicious it was, simply give it a taste yourself!",
    "I was extremely disappointed with my experience. The glasses I received were horribly out of focus and the staff failed to properly measure my pupils for positioning. They attempted to convince me that the glasses could be repositioned, but it would have resulted in an uncomfortable fit. Despite requesting the lenses to be redone urgently, I still have not received my glasses.",
    "This place is the greatest! They have everything you need at great prices. The staff, though there may be a language barrier, is friendly and helpful. Highly recommended for computer item needs.",
    "I loved the Clue game theme at this hotel! The staff, including bell boys, valet drivers, and bartenders, were all respectful and provided great service. The phone etiquette was exceptional and the customer service was top-notch. My girlfriend and I would definitely return next year as the hotel is located in a great area, albeit with some busy streets in downtown Boise. Coming from California, we were impressed by the phenomenal service. However, it is worth being mindful of your spending as food at the hotel can be expensive. One downside was the lack of air vent in the bathrooms, including ours. Overall, a great experience but consider looking for cheaper dining options nearby.",
    "I tried the strawberry flavor at this Atlantic City location and it was amazing! It's not too sweet, but just perfect. I loved the added bits of strawberry in it. The price is also great, only $2 for a small size. My only regret is not trying the other flavors. I will definitely be getting this again next time I'm in Philly/AC!",
    "I had an amazing lunch yesterday! The staff was incredibly friendly and the portions were almost enough for two people. The recipes, passed down from Mrs. Doll, truly shine through with her son carrying on the legacy.",
    "The Bridgeport Rib House offers tasty take-out options with fair prices. However, the bar service for pick-up orders falls short compared to other local barbecue establishments.",
    "The recently revamped menu and increased prices at this place were disappointing. The food was mediocre, and as a beginner cook, I could tell it was not up to par. The food also seemed old, as if it had been sitting out for weeks. The hostess was friendly, but the waiter's incompetence in serving wine was frustrating. Overall, this restaurant is not worth the money, despite their attempt to appear high-end. I had a better experience during happy hour with friends.",
    "Excellent customer service! Brought in my watch for a battery change and they noticed a missing pin, which they fixed for free. Although the wait was a bit long, they were extremely friendly and didn't charge me for the battery. Highly recommended for purchasing jewelry.",
    "This place offers the best of Jewish deli, Southern comfort, and Mexican cuisine. The brisket is flavorful, but don't expect a tomato-based sauce. The latke is a unique and delicious twist on the traditional round one. I also highly recommend the Jewish Apple Cake - even after a few hours on a flight back to LA, it remained delicious, despite being a little overcooked on the bottom.",
    "The food is average, but the main draw of this place is renting a karaoke room for big groups and bringing your own drinks. The restaurant handles large and rowdy groups well, with decently priced and fast service. The karaoke machines have a good selection of up-to-date songs in multiple languages.",
    "This long overdue update of my review for Khyber is simply excellent! Despite moving further away, I still frequent this place. Their Southern barbecue, especially the brisket, ribs, and chicken, is outstanding. The mac and cheese is a must-try side dish, and the coleslaw complements the meal perfectly. The lively vibe of Khyber adds to the experience, always bustling but never too loud. The knowledgeable staff offers great beer recommendations and tasting options. Khyber strikes the perfect balance where I never feel overly intoxicated or out of place.",
    "This bakery offers outstanding bread, particularly the German rye. The poached eggs for breakfast are cooked to perfection. The eggplant panini and Laurie's salad make delightful lunch choices.",
    "Tony's is a hidden gem in Chalmette, serving some of the best Mexican food in Louisiana. The chiles rellenos are a must-try, while their authentic Mexican Coca-Cola is a sweet treat. Overall, a surprisingly great dining experience with consistently delicious dishes.",
    "Terrible business model, confusing ordering process, unprofessional staff, and insufficient filling in my sandwich. Overall, one of the worst experiences I've had recently.",
    "Overall, the staff at this dancewear store are friendly and attentive. They offer a range of quality products at reasonable prices. However, the limited options for men's dancewear can be disappointing. The location is convenient for city residents, and it's a good first stop when in need of new dancewear. However, there is a high probability of not finding the desired item three out of four times.",
    "I highly recommend this place! I was referred here and it was a fantastic experience. I got my hair done in just five hours, with three women working on my medium-sized individuals. The cost was $150, including the hair. The staff was very nice, and I will definitely be returning.",
    "The lamb gyros plate is a must-try, worth driving the distance for. The tiramisu is delicious as well. Dolmas are decent, but a bit too vinegary for my taste. The Greek salad accompanying the entree is also enjoyable.",
    "The yum yum club is amazing, and their macaroni salad is awesome! While the service could be friendlier at times, I keep going back because the price is right and the food tastes great.",
    "My husband and I had a fantastic first experience in Reno thanks to this hotel. Our room was amazing, with a spa and a steam room in the shower. The hotel had great dining options and a clean and enjoyable casino. We were even lucky enough to win $41 with a $1 slot machine. Although Reno itself didn't impress us much, our hotel made up for it. The easy checkout from our room was a convenient time saver. If you're looking for a nice, clean, and modern hotel, this is the one to choose.",
    "Based on the previous Yelp reviews, we decided to take the kids to this hibachi and sushi place. It definitely lived up to the hype. The sushi was incredible, the hibachi was fantastic, and the dessert of fried bananas and ice cream was the perfect ending to a wonderful experience. The service was excellent and attentive. We will definitely be coming back for more!",
    "I absolutely love this place! The pizza is fantastic, the staff is incredibly friendly, and it's a perfect spot for some quality time with friends and family.",
    "I recently visited with friends for food and drinks and had an excellent experience. The service was fantastic, and the drinks were top-notch. I'll definitely be returning!",
    "The lamb was tasty, but disappointed with the frozen garlic Naan from Trader Joe's. Pricey for the portion size and the owner misleadingly claimed to accept Amex. Unlikely to revisit.",
    "Hidden gem in Brentwood! This shop offers innovative flavors like pumpkin and whipped cream cheese. The owner, Michael, is incredibly friendly and generous with samples. Can't wait to try out his next creations!",
    "The food and coffee are great, although I wish they had a bigger espresso bar with more options. The baked goods and other food are absolutely spectacular.",
    "Holly Grove is the best. Their selection of produce is consistently impressive, offering everything you need and more that you won't find at a regular grocery store. It's a great place to support local growers and makers, with locally raised meats and bread from local bakeries. The atmosphere is pleasant, with people always tending to the garden outside. The only downside is its location, but that's not their fault.",
    "We tried this place for the first time last night and overall, it was a good experience. The service was a bit slow, possibly due to the busy Saturday night during March Madness. The complimentary homemade chips were fantastic, although they took longer to arrive than my husband's salad. The restaurant had a kid's movie playing on one of the nearby televisions, which kept my 3-year-old entertained. The food was great, with my burger and seasoned fries being wonderful. However, my husband's blackened chicken was a bit too spicy due to being over-seasoned. My daughter's macaroni and cheese looked delicious, but she couldn't resist eating the chips instead. The seating arrangement inside was a bit odd, with a table located close to the women's restroom door. Personally, I found it strange and ended up waiting until I got home to use the restroom. On a positive note, they offer a 15% military discount, which was much appreciated. Despite the slower service, I would still recommend this place, although I would have given it 5 stars if the service had been a bit better.",
    "The hotel was a decent option in downtown Tampa. We stayed in the suite with a fold-out couch, which was comfortable. We unfortunately missed the happy hour with free drinks, but it's a cool amenity. The complimentary breakfast was amazing, featuring made-to-order omelets, fresh fruit, cereal, toast, bacon, sausage, home fries, juice, and pastries. The room was modern, with two TVs, clean, and had a strong shower.",
    "I had a fantastic experience at this downtown St. Petersburg restaurant. The cozy ambiance gave it a homely feel, and the burgers were bursting with flavor. The arugula added a delightful touch to the chicken and potato gratin. However, I wasn't a fan of the cheese used in the gratin. Despite this, I will definitely be back for the burgers. The only downside was the slightly high prices for wine, so I opted not to order any. Overall, the atmosphere was wonderful, and our waitress was excellent.",
    "I have been a loyal customer at Cd Roma's for over a decade and I absolutely love it. The new location has a modern vibe while still maintaining delicious food. The Chicken Parm, Eggplant Parm, house salad, and Alfredo are my favorites, and their pizza is great too. The made-to-order Alfredo sauce is heavenly with their breadsticks. However, some appetizers like frozen cheesesticks and calamari could use improvement. Overall, I still prefer Cd Roma's over Olive Garden, despite missing the cozy old school atmosphere.",
    "The Waffle House offers consistent quality, but the business model with their yelling and limited dining area is not my preference. Nonetheless, I still eagerly anticipate their breakfast.",
    "Henry is an exceptional rock star in the storage locker industry. He is knowledgeable, professional, courteous, and personable. We had a great experience and even our dog, Marley, was warmly welcomed. Highly recommended!",
    "This restaurant is phenomenal! The location, ambience, food, and drinks are all great. Sitting at the bar is a must, especially with Jared, the talented mixologist. The extensive menu never disappoints, and the specials are always wonderful. Highly recommend this place!",
    "This place has a great location and offers fresh, varied vegan options. However, besides that, I found it pretty average. The crispy ranch and curry tofu dishes were enjoyable, but I expected more from a specialty vegan restaurant. The chick'n in the crispy ranch and the fries were highlights, but the green lemonade was too sweet for my taste. While it's worth trying for its unique items, I wouldn't consider it amazing considering the price range.",
    "Terrible experience! Unfriendly staff, dirty environment, and overall unpleasant. Would not recommend.",
    "Highly recommend this vegan restaurant in New Orleans! Delicious and flavorful food with a wide variety of options to choose from. The bread pudding was a standout for me. Generous portions at affordable prices. Don't miss out!",
    "Magical Vegan Heaven is a small gem with delicious food that even non-vegans will love. My wife couldn't get enough of their Philly steak and I thoroughly enjoyed the curry tofu wrap. Limited seating may be a concern if you prefer to dine in, but their food is perfect for takeout. The kale lemonade alone deserves a 5-star rating. We can't wait to visit again on our next trip to Philly.",
    "My wife and I highly recommend this place! Great management, attentive service, and delicious food. Don't miss the Tiger Roll, Pink Lady Roll, and Tornado Roll. Ask for Billy, he's our favorite. Overall, a must-visit spot in the area. Enjoy!",
    "Amazing spot for lunch in NOLA! Their fried chicken is to die for, and the red beans and rice are incredibly tasty. We always make it a point to stop by when in town. The staff is super friendly and attentive, and the prices are very reasonable.",
    "Mint is a must-visit spot in my neighborhood. Their menu offers endless good choices, and the Taro Tapioca Smoothie is an absolute delight for anyone with a sweet tooth.",
    "The salsa and guacamole are freshly made daily, accompanied by homemade chips. The shrimp burrito was sizable, yet delicious and fresh. The wait staff, however, was only average.",
    "I had high expectations for this place, but it fell short. The calzones were decent, but the crust was disappointing and not doughy enough. The meat fillings were a bit lacking, and the dessert had an odd spice and lacked apple chunks. Despite the convenient location and vibe, it didn't live up to the hype for me. Might give it another chance, but unsure.",
    "This Philadelphia gem offers an amazing view, impeccable service, and great fare. Nick, our incredible server, recommended a delicious wine that perfectly complemented our dishes. A must-visit spot to witness fabulous views and stunning sunsets.",
    "The food is excellent, but the long wait times and lack of proper staffing make it difficult to enjoy. Management should improve the scheduling and turnover process to avoid frustrating customers. Unfortunately, I won't be returning based on this experience.",
    "I ordered my usual breakfast at Terraza, which was eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and wheat toast with salsa on the side. The hashbrowns were undercooked, but everything else was good. The service was efficient and the portion sizes were large and affordable. I enjoyed sitting on their shaded patio, and the server was cheerful. Terraza is a great option for breakfast with a terrace, and I plan on trying their lunch options next.",
    "This all you can eat place offers decent value at $27/adult, but the quality falls short when ordering from the regular menu. The maki rolls are average, but mine were too cold, indicating they had been pre-made and refrigerated. The oyster ponzu lacked the ponzu flavor and had a heavy coating comparable to an A+W onion ring. If you're extremely hungry and craving rolls and greasy tempura, this place is suitable. However, I recommend avoiding the squid.",
    "Called after a negative experience with another locksmith. They responded punctually, completed the job within an hour, and even provided 4 complimentary keys. Truly exceptional service.",
    "This place is extremely crowded in an unpleasant way. The strong odor of patrons' body odor mixed with dirty bathrooms makes for an unappetizing experience. The prices are not worth the average food, and the service is lacking. Numerous better options are available in Philly's food scene, so it's recommended to avoid wasting time and money here. Head elsewhere instead.",
    "I had high hopes for this place with its good beer selection and knowledgeable staff. However, the food was a major letdown. The fries were undercooked and inedible, while the burgers were inconsistently cooked and served on hard, cold buns. The service was lackluster at best. We couldn't even eat the food and left it untouched, but were still charged full price. I wouldn't recommend eating here, unless you're drunk and don't care about the quality.",
    "I initially had a disappointment with the wrong order, but the employees were friendly in fixing it. However, the food made up for it in the end. On my second visit, the pizza steak exceeded my expectations with generous portions of cheese, meat, and sauce. This place has redeemed itself and might become my new go-to for pizza steaks.",
    "IBP is the perfect spot to unwind on a Saturday night after a show. Despite the busy Happy Hour, the late-night crowds are relaxed and there's always seating available. It's a great alternative to Chinatown or Dive bars nearby. Additionally, IBP offers a variety of sports packages and has a separate jukebox and pool tables upstairs for entertainment.",
    "The Village pub has a great beer selection, welcoming atmosphere, and good service. The happy hour with half price beer and the dog-friendly deck are definite highlights. The key lime pie is also delicious. However, the smoking allowed on the deck is a downside. The food, particularly the pretzels and cheese dip, falls short. The pretzel bun sandwiches are pricey and underwhelming, with soggy buns. It would be better if the pub focused on serving beer and allowed customers to bring in sandwiches from next door.",
    "Modern Laundry is an exceptional establishment that I am thoroughly pleased with. The facility is always clean and has a pleasant ambiance, thanks to the employees who genuinely seem to enjoy their work. The fluff and fold service exceeded my expectations - my clothes were flawlessly cleaned and expertly folded, giving them a freshly-purchased feel. Notably, their use of environmentally friendly detergent further impressed me. Modern Laundry has effortlessly won me over, making laundry just another convenient stop on my to-do list.",
    "The food and atmosphere are great, as expected in the CBD. However, the back room can feel stuffy on busy days. I highly recommend trying their delicious raw oysters and burgers. Prices are slightly higher for lunch, but worth it.",
    "Highly recommend this small shop! It's definitely worth the drive. The wine cakes are exceptional. Went based on Yelp reviews and will be returning for sure.",
    "The Love exceeded my expectations. Exceptional Father's Day lunch with a wide array of delicious choices on the menu. Professional and accommodating service, lovely atmosphere, and hot and tasty dishes with surprising additions. Greens on every plate - my warm spinach salad was a delightful addition. The Belgium waffles with corn meal and Blueberry butter were a hit. They even serve our favorite La Columbe coffee. Couldn't ask for more.",
    "Overall, the sushi roll was enjoyable but the limited options were a downside. The experience at the hibachi grill was disappointing, as my steak was overcooked despite specifying medium doneness twice. Additionally, everyone in my group felt that the chicken lacked seasoning. It is important to note that the advertised late happy hour from 8-11 was not available, even though the website did not mention any location-specific information. The staff claimed it was for a different location, but this was not clearly indicated on their website.",
    "I was excited to try Lee How Fook after reading positive Yelp reviews, but unfortunately, I was left disappointed. The small size of the restaurant didn't bother me, but it's advisable to make reservations due to limited tables. The service was adequate, although understanding the server was a bit difficult. As for the food, the appetizers were delicious with a flavorful dipping sauce. However, the sweet & sour chicken was overly sweet and the vegetables were undercooked. The pan-fried noodle dishes lacked flavor and the supposed spicy beef wasn't spicy at all. Overall, I left full but unsatisfied.",
    "The hot chicken is outstanding, possibly the best I've had despite being from the South. However, the small portion size comes at a high price. The drinks are also incredibly impressive.",
    "Lee How Fook serves the best General Tso chicken I've ever had. Give it a try and let me know what you think. -  Coolie",
    "Chef John Besh at Luke connected to the Hilton hotel on St. Charles deserves a huge thank you! We ended up eating here multiple times during our stay because the food was so delicious. The traditional dishes were great, but the surprise winner was the burger. Despite being hesitant to order a burger in New Orleans, it turned out to be one of the best I've ever had - juicy, flavorful, and huge. Don't miss out on their amazing bread pudding a la mode, it's mouth-watering and freshly baked.",
    "Disappointed to discover that this location is closed when I specifically came for their delicious fish tacos.",
    "Jacob from Alpine Locksmiths provided excellent and efficient service when I lost my car keys while skiing at Squaw. He quickly gave me a fair price quote and arrived at the agreed time. In just a few minutes, he retrieved our key code and made new keys. I highly recommend Alpine for their honest and quick assistance. Although I hope to not need their help again in the same circumstance, they will be my first call if I ever lose my keys again.",
    "Terrible service, never got to try the food. Despite being seated for over 45 minutes, we were still without water and had multiple waiters who failed to assist us. Ended up leaving and went to Dat Dog across the street where we were impressed with their hot dogs. Thanks Dat Dogs!",
    "Terrible experience, order was 75% incorrect and missing items. Disappointed.",
    "Farmhaus was worth the wait. Despite a slight delay in seating, the menu helped us plan our meal in advance. The smoked fish dip and escolar with prawns were fantastic, while the meatloaf was a bit dry and bland. The service was good, considering how busy the restaurant was. I am excited to try their blue plate special lunches and would love to go back for dinner when there is outdoor seating.",
    "The customer service at Dish is seriously lacking. Despite making a reservation for three people two weeks in advance, we were seated at a tiny table barely fit for two. Adjacent to us, an extra person was added, resulting in an uncomfortably cramped dining experience. When we requested a proper table for three, we were rudely told it was a take it or leave it situation. This unpleasant encounter ruined what was supposed to be a special night out, and as a result, we will no longer be dining at this restaurant.",
    "Overall, the restaurant was pretty good. The milkshake was amazing, one of the best I've ever had. The food and service were good too, but there was a slightly strange vibe that I couldn't pinpoint. Could just be me though!",
    "This restaurant falls short of providing authentic Greek cuisine. The menu offers Americanized versions of Mediterranean classics, and the chefs have made several mistakes in traditional Greek recipes. For an authentic experience, it is recommended to visit Greektown in Detroit or Toronto. Avoid this place.",
    "The best meal in New Orleans! The set price menu was amazing - fresh strawberry salad, outstanding chicken, and a yummy chocolate cake. Vegetarian options were great too. The staff was attentive and the location was excellent. Definitely the best meal in town.",
    "The front desk staff, specifically Kris, provided excellent service by going above and beyond during a heavy rainstorm. They walked the reviewer and their pet, Leo, to the car with an umbrella. The reviewer has been taking their nervous pet, Leonidas, to the clinic for two years. Since seeing Dr. Deutsch, they have found him to be the best in terms of thoroughness and ensuring Leo's comfort.",
    "\"Farm fresh at its finest. Inventive, flavorful dishes and perfectly portioned. Cozy dining room, friendly atmosphere and attentive service provide the ideal backdrop for catching up with loved ones. Don't forget to bring your own wine, and definitely try the Bloody Beet Steak!\"",
    "Bomb offers a delicious Island Bowl that I always go for. Highly recommended for a healthy and satisfying meal. \"For your health!\" - Dr. Steve Bruhle",
    "The burger had a deliciously juicy and glistening presence, elevated by high-quality ingredients. However, the thick slice of bacon was disappointingly pure white fat and didn't melt as desired. While the food was great, the communal table trend was disliked due to having to listen to strangers' conversations.",
    "I've been a member at this convenient and reasonably priced gym for a few weeks now and I'm enjoying it. They have all the basic amenities, including plenty of cardio machines, weights, a lap pool, a spin class room, and a big aerobics studio. The staff is really nice and you get a free personal trainer session upon signing up. Your membership fee also allows you to use their other locations at no extra cost. They offer limited babysitting hours for those with kids. The only downsides are the late weekend opening time and the lack of early morning group fitness classes, except for a 5:45am spin class. Overall, if you're looking for a gym with friendly people and good equipment without the fancy extras, joining LA Fitness will save you some money.",
    "If you're in Santa Barbara and craving sushi, Hiro San is your go-to. His mastery of the craft is unparalleled, and his friendly demeanor adds to the overall experience. Don't miss the chance to sit before this amazing chef, it's truly worth it.",
    "This theater may be outdated, but the low prices and friendly staff make it worth visiting. Despite never being crowded, it offers a wide selection of major and Indie films that are hard to find elsewhere. Waiting for a movie to come here is a better choice in my opinion.",
    "Fun place with an inviting interior and great outdoor seating. Brunch food was delicious and the beer selection was outstanding. However, our experience was dampened by a rude and unhelpful waiter who seemed unfamiliar with the menu, frequently disappeared, and brought out the wrong order twice. Disappointing service, or else this place would have earned four stars.",
    "The restaurant offers a creative menu and the food is great. However, the lack of reservations can be a downside, especially on weekends. Additionally, waiting for a late friend can be a bit inconvenient since everyone in the party needs to be seated together. We also enjoyed the neighboring La Mulita.",
    "Cool Springs on a Thursday had a comfortable 15-minute wait, even when Bonefish Grill was crowded. The food is consistently amazing.",
    "We had a great experience at this busy restaurant in Tarpon Springs. The staff was efficient and our waiter was friendly. The food, including the Gyro, Chicken Slouvaki, and Spanokopita, was delicious. The only slight issue was that the top filo dough crust of the Spanokopita was a bit harder than desired. Overall, we enjoyed our visit and will definitely be returning when in Tarpon Springs.",
    "The Gryphon Cafe is a hidden gem near Wayne Starbucks that attracts coffee aficionados with its serene ambiance and strong espresso lattes. While their baked goods may be hit or miss, the caf\u00e9 supports a thriving local music scene with live performances on weekends.",
    "Metamorphosis Tattoo Shop is worth giving five stars. Unlike other shops in Indianapolis, they run their business professionally and respect their customers. Trevor provided a fun and respectful 4-hour tattoo experience, giving me the tattoo I wanted in the location I desired. The prices are average, and they ask for a non-refundable deposit to ensure seriousness. Don't waste your time elsewhere, as Metamorphosis is a diamond in the rough. No rock star attitudes here. Can't wait to go back to Trevor.",
    "I had a great experience with the lengua burrito. It had a clean presentation and wasn't greasy. The affordable price made it even more enjoyable. Looking forward to trying their flan next time.",
    "The restaurant had poor and dark lighting, making it difficult to see the food. Unfortunately, all the dishes were average in taste. Disappointing, as I had higher expectations.",
    "The banana pudding at this shop is absolutely amazing, even without extra toppings. The staff is genuinely caring and welcoming, making it a great experience for customers. I highly recommend supporting this shop and hope it continues to thrive for years to come.",
    "Shepard's lacks accountability and provides poor customer service. Despite finding my lost organizer, they refused to address the missing $100 bill and did not take any steps to investigate the issue or help me retrieve my money. It is frustrating that they do not take responsibility for their guests' belongings.",
    "This restaurant consistently ignores negative feedback and fails to address their issues. Dinner experience was terrible with a prime rib that was mostly fat and gristle. Even my dog refused to eat the leftovers. Cold fries were served and my request for regular butter was ignored. It's disappointing that the owner, Jeanne, does not make an effort to resolve these problems.",
    "I'm giving them 4 stars because I haven't tried enough of their menu, but they have improved their pizza. The vegan general tso's pizza was delicious with a crispy and flavorful crust, generous \"chicken\" toppings, and a slight kick. They accommodated my vegan request and resolved a pricing issue promptly. Delivery was on time and hot. I highly recommend trying their homemade seitan. Will order from them again.",
    "Conveniently located restaurant attached to Drury Plaza hotel, perfect for unfamiliar area. Good service for our large group, only minor issue with forgotten drinks. Huge portions and delicious food, especially the massive and tasty Cuban sandwich. The shandy is good, but avoid the margaritas, particularly the patron one. The shrimp tacos have a kick, but are still tasty.",
    "Papertini deserves every single one of those glowing 5 stars! Their creatively designed wedding masterpieces go beyond traditional flowers with unique elements like papers, wires, and luxe fabrics. The team is not only talented but also friendly \u2013 a true asset to your wedding team. If you want something unique without being artsy-fartsy, I highly recommend them!",
    "Mr. B's in New Orleans is a must-visit for a tasty and satisfying brunch. From the moment you step in, the jazz music creates a cozy atmosphere. The fresh loaf of bread is divine and the gumbo ya-ya is exactly what you'd expect. The BBQ shrimp, despite being messy, are rich and flavorful, accompanied by a divine sauce. Service is friendly and efficient, although the prices are a bit steep. If you have the chance, definitely give their brunch a try.",
    "Nice steakhouse in St. Louis with a great view of the arch. The appetizers were okay, but the crab cakes were above average. Scallops were too sweet for my taste, but the filet mignon was exceptional - cooked perfectly rare. The wine list was above average, making it a great night out.",
    "Recently, three of us at the office tried San Antonio Taco for the first time. Unfortunately, the food did not meet our expectations based on the reviews. The refried beans were overly salty and the rice was clumpy. Additionally, my beef enchiladas were difficult to eat as the beef was stringy and not prepared properly. Although I usually give a restaurant a second chance, I am uncertain if I will do so this time.",
    "Cousin's in North Philly is the go-to spot over Fresh Grocer. Although the produce may not be top-notch and the hours can be inconvenient, you can find most essentials here for much cheaper than anywhere else. It's conveniently located near my apartment and a great alternative when you don't want to go to Trader Joe's. I'll be heading there tomorrow.",
    "I've been to this place twice and it really depends on what you order. The Sausage and Pepper Pizza and the cream puff were amazing, but other items were just okay. The pizza had great flavor and the sausage/peppers had a nice kick. The cream puff cream was delicious and I wish it topped every dessert. The other sweets and bagels were good, but not great. The pepperoni pizza was bland and the pepperoni was sparse. The wait time was also frustrating. Despite these issues, I'll be back to try more of their treats, hoping for better experiences.",
    "This speakeasy is a must-visit for its cool and chill atmosphere, combining class with a casual vibe. It's ideal for enjoying excellent cocktails/drinks accompanied by great music. However, be cautious as they only serve one unappetizing appetizer dish. Don't go expecting tasty food; it stays true to being a speakeasy.",
    "Terrible experience. Overpaid for spoiled food and received an incorrect order. Won't be going back.",
    "I would rate it 3.5 stars. They didn't have what I wanted and weren't willing to accommodate my requests. The glazed donuts were thick and dry, but the sliders and sundae were tasty. Probably won't come back.",
    "I highly recommend this small cafe for its popular breakfast and brunch options. The salmon scramble with egg whites and tofu with brown rice breakfast plate were both delicious. The service was efficient, and I was seated promptly.",
    "Went for dinner on a Friday at 6pm, expecting a packed place, but luckily it wasn't. Staff is friendly, atmosphere is like Magnolia Journal. Food and drinks are pretty dang good. Minus a star for slow cocktail service and appetizer arriving with the main course. Understandable as they're new, and I've worked in hospitality before.",
    "The restaurant provides a quiet and nostalgic 1960's business ambience perfect for dining. Their menu offers both Tony's specialties and bar options; personally, I highly recommend the Risotto. Our table tried the special linguine with shrimp and lobster, as well as the strip steak, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The service was exceptional, striking the perfect balance between attentiveness and not being overbearing.",
    "This sushi spot is simply amazing! Their rolls are huge, service is excellent, and my personal favorites are the heat attack appetizer, Sapporo roll, and honey roll. The deep-fried rolls are a must-try, and everything looks incredibly fresh and appetizing. The presentation is top-notch. If you're feeling adventurous, go for the spicy sashimi bowl.",
    "I had two visits at this bar and both times the service at the bar was terrible. The bartenders were unfriendly and showed no acknowledgment or response to my presence. Even though the bar had good reviews overall, the bartenders' attitude made me walk out and go elsewhere.",
    "I absolutely love it here! Great atmosphere, wide range of options, and the lunch bento boxes are amazing. Don't miss out on their boba either. Those who complain are just overly picky. Give their beef braised soup a try, it's hearty and delicious.",
    "This place exceeded our expectations! The decor is beautiful, creating a great atmosphere. The food is amazing and of better quality compared to other places at a similar price point. My husband loved the udon noodles, and the rolls, especially the Spicy Salmon, were a must-try. The flavors were tasteful, not overpowering. Overall, we had a wonderful experience here!",
    "Lovely hotel with extremely friendly and helpful front desk staff. We enjoyed a peaceful night's sleep in a room away from the club. Perfect for those seeking a fun experience, but opt for a different location if you prefer a quiet stay.",
    "The pizza and gnocchi here are amazing! The dishes are made with fresh ingredients and the menu has a nice variety. The atmosphere feels like a cozy family restaurant in Europe. Definitely the best pizza in middle Tennessee.",
    "I had high expectations for a $16 haircut, but I was pleasantly surprised. The haircut was professionally done, complemented my face shape, and improved the health of my hair. The shampoo smelled great and the stylist was thorough. The only downside was the waiting time, but it was worth it for the quality result. The salon's focus on training and checklists ensures a great experience. Just remember to allocate enough time for the appointment.",
    "My daughter's wedding at the Presidio Chapel was an absolute dream come true. Rain Longo, the coordinator, was incredibly patient, supportive, and enthusiastic throughout the entire process. The chapel itself provided an outstanding and authentic atmosphere, and the beautiful adjoining room was perfect for getting ready. The 6-hour rental was affordable and all the staff made our special day absolutely perfect. Thank you to everyone involved!",
    "I had a mixed experience at the waxing salon. Miriam, the wax specialist, was knowledgeable and efficient. However, she focused more on promoting products and criticizing my regular shaving instead of providing a satisfactory experience. While my brows and lower legs were well done, there were stray hairs left on my underarms. Additionally, small traces of wax were left on my skin. Overall, I left feeling unprepared for the beach.",
    "The food at this restaurant was very good, especially the pad see ew and The King and I stir fry. The only issue was the noise level, as it was difficult to have a conversation without shouting. If they can improve the noise level, they would definitely receive a higher rating. The portion sizes were decent and the service was attentive. Overall, a positive experience with the exception of the noise level.",
    "I had a negative experience with this rental car company. Not only was my valuable radar detector stolen from the car, but the cleanliness of the vehicles was also subpar. I found plastic bottles and sticky substances in the car multiple times, showing a lack of attention to detail. I hope they review their surveillance cameras to identify the employee responsible for theft and provide me with a refund.",
    "This place is amazing! The atmosphere is laid back and welcoming, and they even let us bring our dog. We enjoyed sitting on the cozy wrap around porch outside. It was the perfect ending to our trip, and the food kept me full for the long car ride home. I had the delicious but rich bananas foster French toast, and although I couldn't finish it due to the generous portion size, it was still amazing. My fianc\u00e9 opted for the vegetable omelet, a healthier choice that was also delicious. I can't wait to go back and try something else from their menu, perhaps one of their famous juices next time.",
    "Great food, generous portions for the price! The staff, especially the girl behind the counter, is incredibly friendly and always wears a smile. Wish I worked closer, would love to visit more often.",
    "The scenery is stunning, providing a beautiful backdrop for running, walking, hiking, and biking. The trail offers ample opportunities to rest and take short breaks at various seating spots.",
    "Extremely slow service; a 40-minute wait for a pasta and salad. Not the fault of the waitress, but rather the kitchen. Perfect if you're hoping to prolong your date.",
    "This place is a wonderful Mexican restaurant located downtown. The chips, salsa, beans, and guacamole are all delicious. The chimichanga bites are fantastic with their amazing sauce. The street tacos and enchiladas for dinner are amazing. Although they don't have a full bar, their margaritas are strong and tasty. The service is very good, with a friendly and attentive server. Overall, a 4 out of 5 stars as it's a good Mexican restaurant, just not my absolute favorite.",
    "Holy Rolls is an incredible find! With their tasty rolls, excellent service, reasonable prices, and abundant healthy choices, it's a true gem. Don't miss out on their sushi, it's worth every dollar!",
    "We had an outstanding experience at this restaurant. The food, including Gumbo Ya Ya, BBQ shrimp, and crab cakes, was exceptional, and the service was fantastic. We enjoyed everything we ordered and strongly recommend this place.",
    "Amazing 20-minute workout! Skeptic turned believer, I'm now addicted and feeling fantastic. Chelsey is an awesome trainer to work with too!",
    "Overall Rating: 3 stars\n\nThe adorable atmosphere and outstanding location of this restaurant receive 5 stars. However, the food experience was a bit underwhelming. The smoked turkey club I had was mostly good, but the meat was not impressive. The creamed spinach was enjoyable, but the mac n cheese was dry and bland, which was disappointing considering the additional cost. Despite this, I am not giving up on this place yet. I am determined to go back and try something else because I really want to love it.",
    "Brunch on NYE weekend was amazing! Cozy decor, devoured the delicious Eggs Veney in minutes. Great food and a wonderful experience!",
    "Ali Ba Ba's is definitely a hidden gem in NOLA for late-night kababs, shwarma, and gyros. Despite the higher price and limited hot sauce options, their gyros are tastier than the nearby slice joint or hot dog stands. While they can be a bit slow with service, the larger portion sizes and satisfying flavors make it worth the visit.",
    "This place offers great food, incredible customer service, and is a hidden gem in the community with an excellent location.",
    "I had an amazing experience at this place! The Turkish coffee was delightful, and the veggie wrap and cheese steak were also delicious. The restaurant's caf\u00e9 section and overall ambiance were great. I'll definitely return if I'm in West Philly again. 5 stars!",
    "I love Jones! The food is divine with comfort food to the max. The calamari is the best I've had in a while. The Duncan Hines yellow cake for dessert is a genius choice. The roast beef dinner is a winner, and the halibut has amazing flavor. Can't wait to go back again, yum yum yum!",
    "The Penang chicken with chicken flavored white rice is consistently delicious whether in Boston or Philly. Despite the long line, we were seated surprisingly quickly within 15-20 minutes. From start to finish, the service was fast, allowing me to enjoy the juicy and amazing chicken without much wait. I made the mistake of not ordering to go, and regretted it as soon as I got back home. Next time, I'll indulge and be greedy by getting takeout to enjoy in Virginia.",
    "The wait time was excessively long with plenty of available seating options.",
    "Screamagedon is an awesome and thrilling attraction, definitely worth visiting again next year. Some of the houses feel incredibly realistic, adding to the overall experience. The haunted hayride with fire torches, machine guns, chainsaws, demonic priests, and churches is absolutely spectacular. Walking through the woods with only a glow stick is both awesome and scary, giving a very real feeling. Forget about other popular Halloween events like Bush Gardens Howl-O-Scream and Halloween Horror Nights, Screamagedon has it all.",
    "Overall, I had an excellent experience with this service. After requesting online, I received a callback within 30-45 minutes and was able to schedule an appointment swiftly. Shanna, the professional, arrived promptly and provided valuable information about prevention methods. She thoroughly checked both mine and my daughter's heads and provided full treatment. Although it was a bit pricey, I had already tried over-the-counter solutions and was not satisfied. The comb they used, which is not sold in stores, was highly effective at gathering nits. My only complaint is that the comb should be included in the session, rather than being an additional cost. However, I purchased it for future use.",
    "The BBQ Chicken Sandwich is a great deal at only $5.75! The chicken was perfectly grilled and you have the freedom to choose your own toppings/sauces. The option of grilled sourdough, wheat bun, or white bun adds variety to the sandwich. Overall, a neat and affordable choice.",
    "Delivery took excessively long, despite being close by. Claimed driver had numerous orders to deliver, which is absurd. Waited almost two hours, highly disappointing. Shrimp scampi was oddly prepared, with excessive additions. Only redeeming item was the sweet potato cheesecake. Cheesecake deserves five stars, but I would only consider ordering that item again from this place.",
    "Despite the pretentious service and long wait, this place serves the absolute best burger. That's all you need to know.",
    "The hi-energy gym in Tampa is impressive! I utilized my Perms Plus membership while visiting from Atlanta and had a great experience. The yoga class was enjoyable, and the gym itself is spacious with a wide variety of equipment. Additionally, the free two-hour parking in the garage was convenient, and I even received two guest passes for my local coworker.",
    "Always fresh and delicious homemade food. Friendly staff and great Italian specialties. The rolls are also excellent. Disregard the negative comment, the owners truly care about customer satisfaction.",
    "I purchased a used 09 Rav4 from Glanzmann Subaru last month. The process was simple, but I was disappointed with the vehicle's description. There were several aesthetic defects not mentioned by the sales team, which took away from the overall value. I expected a more honest and direct interaction from this family-owned dealership. I urge Mr. Jeff Glanzmann to prioritize honesty in their sales process.",
    "I wholeheartedly agree with the 5-star reviews! This boutique is exceptionally clean and well-maintained. Lori's waxing skills are top-notch, and she made me feel entirely at ease. The blue hard wax surpassed my expectations, and I won't be returning to regular waxing again. The option for a custom wax is an added bonus. Thanks to Yelp reviewers, I discovered this gem and have already booked my next appointment.",
    "Avoid this dealership at all costs. Despite my multiple attempts to give them another chance, they consistently find ways to take advantage of customers. Even though my whole family drives Hyundai, I will no longer be dealing with them.",
    "My girlfriends and I dined at the Creole House for dinner due to its proximity to our hotel. The bacon garlic oysters were average, as the flavors were overpowered by the cheese and bacon. The jumbo buffalo wings were tasty and well-seasoned. The jumbalaya pasta lacked flavor and was our least favorite, while the blackened red fish was just okay. The saut\u00e9ed veggies accompanying the dish were excessively salty. The canal street red fish wasn't great and lacked garlic sauce. The paddle boat drinks tasted good but were more juice than alcohol. Overall, the food was underwhelming, earning the restaurant a solid 3 stars. On a positive note, our server, Alexander, provided excellent hospitality and tried his best to ensure our satisfaction.",
    "I had high expectations for BlackFinn due to the hype, but unfortunately, it fell short. The atmosphere and staff were pleasant, but the food was disappointing. My Cuban sandwich had mustard despite requesting it to be held, and my boyfriend's Prime Rib sandwich had more bread than meat. The au jus was also lacking. They forgot the swiss cheese on my sandwich, resulting in multiple returns. The manager was accommodating and apologized, but overall, it was a letdown. Two stars for the polite staff and manager. I might give them another chance, but my boyfriend's doubts remain.",
    "Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience with the service at this Bob Evans location. Despite loving their food, the service really needs improvement. My family and I were seated for 10 minutes without anyone offering us a drink or any service. Although there were waitresses constantly passing by, they didn't bother to acknowledge us. It took two servers to apologize for the misunderstanding about who would serve our table, even though the restaurant wasn't busy. The food was good, but the service was very slow.",
    "I have been consistently using them for my business mail for years and they have been fantastic. The team is great and their service is top-notch. I highly rate and recommend them.",
    "Great pho place in Reno with authentic flavors and reasonable prices. Perfect portions and the homemade fish sauce adds extra deliciousness. Love the small family business atmosphere. Will definitely be returning!",
    "This place is amazing! The gyros are delicious and the takeout service is on point. Although I haven't dined in, the diverse atmosphere with Bosnian people adds to its charm. I've heard the restaurant is also clean. Cheers to this place for their awesome gyros!",
    "This hidden gem of a hookah bar is a must-visit for any hookah enthusiast. Stepping inside, you are greeted with an authentic and inviting atmosphere. The floor cushions and metal mandala tables add to the charm. The menu offers a variety of drinks, food, and hookah flavors at reasonable prices. \"Sex on the beach\" shisha was a crowd favorite - smooth and enjoyable. What sets this place apart is its calm and relaxing ambiance, making it a top choice for those seeking a low-key and peaceful hookah experience.",
    "I found the best salon for a gel manicure through Yelp. The staff was friendly, the salon was beautiful and clean. Kim, my nail tech, did an excellent job. A pleasant experience overall. Will definitely return.",
    "We had an outstanding dining experience at this restaurant. The food was impeccable, from the perfectly cooked Jambalaya and Shrimp Etouffee to the fantastic Seafood Gumbo with a great mix of seafood and okra. The shrimp in the Etouffee dish was firm, clean, and tasted incredibly fresh. The Bread Pudding with praline sauce was a perfect match for the meal, and the Cafe du Monde coffee was a delightful addition. Undoubtedly, one of the best dining experiences we had during our visit to NOLA.",
    "Solid cheesesteaks with tasty cheese fries. However, not unique enough to justify a long journey, as you can find similar options throughout Philadelphia.",
    "Overall, the takoyaki was tasty but a bit doughy and greasy, requiring a acquired taste or being drunk to fully appreciate. It's worth a try for a first venture, but be aware that they are heavy for their size. As for the curry chicken, it was disappointing with a rich roux and not the best I've had. Despite this, it's still worth another visit for Japanese fast food.",
    "This place offers nice wines and a great location. It's a shame they don't serve food, but their dog-friendly policy allows you to bring your own and enjoy the view with your pup. Lovely!",
    "I absolutely loved the atmosphere, Connor's excellent service, and my dinner at this restaurant. The cakes, barley soup, and shrimp ravioli were all delicious, and the Malbec wine complemented my meal perfectly. It was my first visit, and I was thrilled to discover that they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I highly recommend this place and will definitely return in the future.",
    "I highly recommend this place for breakfast. The juevos rancheros were amazing. We also tried the chips and salsa and my wife loved the homemade tamale. Everything tasted great, especially the spicy salsa. We will definitely be returning.",
    "Burger Up offers an upscale take on burgers, with tasty flavors and a variety of toppings. The meat itself lacked flavor, but overall the burger was well-cooked. The truffle fries are a must-try. The beer menu is interesting, featuring unique options from the Deep South. It could be a good spot for post-meal drinks. Overall, Burger Up is a decent alternative to traditional dive bar burgers. 3.50 stars.",
    "Mandala is the perfect place to get all your massage supplies, with great prices and helpful staff. Lisa, who works there, is friendly and knowledgeable. She guided me through their extensive selection of essential oils and created a perfect blend just for me. The shop is affordable, even compared to online prices, and you can try out the products in person without any additional shipping charges. I highly recommend shopping at Mandala to support this fantastic small business. They have recently moved to a charming Victorian-style home on South Virginia.",
    "5/5 stars: Charming shop with delicious food and generous portions. The focus on alcohol shines, particularly with their fantastic ciders. Wasn't a fan of the meads, but fell in love with their cider and even brought one back home to the east coast.",
    "Morning Call is the superior choice for beignets in Metarie compared to this shop. However, if you insist on going to Cafe Du Monde, it's worth the twenty-minute drive to Decatur, including parking.",
    "I highly recommend the beautiful new nail salon on West Chester Pike. The staff is friendly, the salon is brand new, and the prices are good. The serene colors and pedi chairs with phone chargers add to the overall experience.",
    "Wow! I highly recommend this massage place. Simon's hands are incredibly talented in relaxing your muscles and getting rid of any kinks. The atmosphere is comfortable and desirable, making the experience even better. The prices are affordable, and the foot massage was fantastic as well. Don't underestimate the importance of human touch, and I suggest scheduling an appointment during early evening hours for an hour full body massage. This place is a little slice of heaven worth indulging in.",
    "My boyfriend and I finally visited the new sushi spot around the corner and it didn't disappoint! Tuna Bar is a must-visit for sushi lovers. The ambiance, service, and food were exceptional during their soft opening. The owner/executive chef takes pride in his accomplishments, and rightfully so. We're excited to see what's in store for Tuna Bar and can't wait to have it just a short walk away!",
    "This dive bar goes beyond expectations with its old wood panel walls, disgusting smell and tiny drinks. I have no desire to ever return.",
    "Fantastic experience! The food is amazing, atmosphere is great, and the hostess radiates positive energy. My friend loved it and can't wait to return. The shrimp salad with lime chili dressing was a refreshing delight.",
    "The place has significantly deteriorated in terms of food quality. The pork steak was dry and tough, and it would have been nice to have the option to choose a sauce. The BBQ nachos, which we used to enjoy here, were soggy and tasteless. Despite being there on a slow Saturday evening, the quality seemed to have declined. However, the service was still good, just like before. Overall, we most likely won't be returning.",
    "Excellent professional service! Had a great experience today, even though I forgot to ask for my stylist's name. She did an incredibly good job! You have definitely earned my trust.",
    "Had an amazing meal at Spiro's tonight - from the tableside prepared Greek salad to the mouthwatering combo plate with moussaka, dolmas, and lamb. Our server, Ben, was fantastic and even surprised us with a complimentary dessert. We lost track of time because we were so comfortable and well fed. Spiro's will definitely be my new regular spot! Thank you, Ben and the Spiro's crew!",
    "Terrible experience. Long wait time, very brief consultation, and no medication provided for pain relief. Lacks compassion and definitely not recommended for those seeking caring treatment.",
    "The restaurant had good food, with a reasonable price for the meal box. Cashier Alessandra was very polite and respectful. The food tasted great too. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area.",
    "Great initiative on ditching straws for the environment! However, the ingredients in the mixers could be better. Unfortunately, the energy of the bar staff on Saturday evening was lacking, and their Margarita was disappointing. It's a simple drink, so it should have been better.",
    "I attended my first BarreAmped class at the Music Row location and it exceeded my expectations. The class had a welcoming and friendly atmosphere, and the instructor was very attentive. The only downside was the small and oddly shaped room, which could be problematic if the class was at maximum capacity. Additionally, locating the studio was a bit confusing due to the lack of signage. Despite these minor inconveniences, I still had a great workout and would consider going again.",
    "Terrible service. Put on hold multiple times, rude staff, wrong order delivered, and unhelpful response. Avoid at all costs.",
    "The chicken and French toast were amazing! Patio could use more shade, but overall enjoyable experience. Pet-friendly. We'll return!",
    "I am grateful to this place for offering a much needed late-night snack during my visit to Nashville. They allowed pick-up at 2 AM, so I didn't have to wait for delivery. Despite the initial impression that the pizza wouldn't be impressive, it turned out to be surprisingly delicious. My only regret is not ordering a bigger size!",
    "I had a disappointing experience with this delivery service. The food order was wrong, and it arrived over an hour later than promised. Additionally, all the food was either undercooked or overcooked. This was a one-time experience, and I won't be ordering from them again. Disappointing.",
    "Fantastic spot in Nashville for a good time! Amazing drink deals on Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Food is decent.",
    "I love their salads, tea, and french fries! The servers were excellent, and I've been here multiple times, so I'll definitely be back!",
    "Fantastic spot for a family brunch: clean venue, exceptional staff, and delightful decor. A major win as my picky four-year-old even enjoyed the food. Impressive!",
    "I absolutely loved this adorable tea shop! They have an amazing variety of loose leaf teas and tea accessories. The drinks and sweets are not only delicious, but also creatively made. The relaxing ambience makes it a perfect spot to unwind. As a tea enthusiast, I thoroughly enjoyed perusing through the owner's collection of tea books. The owner is incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about tea. I can't wait to visit again!",
    "Excellent food and service, with standout antipasto and freshly flavored pasta. The Fisherman's stew impresses with generous servings of tender fish in saffron sauce.",
    "Muriel's in NOLA is a must-visit. The goat cheese and shrimp crepes are unparalleled, possibly the best I've ever had. The rest of the meal matched the appetizer's excellence. Service is top-notch and the venue captures the essence of the French Quarter. Ghost tours outside the window can be slightly distracting during dinner, but the incredible food makes up for it. Don't believe the rumors - Muriel's is only haunted by its extraordinary cuisine.",
    "Visited this Taco Bell near closing time, initially ignored by the staff despite the open lights. Eventually, a young man at the window helped us.",
    "Cute place to eat at, but disappointed by limited breakfast menu. Okay omelet and flavorless biscuit. Quick seating during the week, but weekends may get crowded.",
    "Expensive but worth it. Upgraded to executive locker rooms for convenience. Some machines need maintenance, but facility is welcoming. Variety of classes and equipment options. Limited weekend hours and inconvenient class schedule. Overall, happy with membership.",
    "This place is amazing! The bar staff, especially Ally, is fantastic. She is incredibly kind and attentive, even when things get busy. The vibe is cool and the indoor and outdoor seating options are great. A wonderful addition to the Funk Zone. Highly recommend, and make sure to say hi to Ally for me! A++",
    "Great experience! The bartender was amazing, offering ice-cold beer and a decent lunch menu. It's best to visit during non-peak hours for consistently good service. Will definitely return.",
    "Great hotel with a friendly environment, perfect for adults and families. Only drawback was not all pools being open during Memorial Day weekend. Loved the variety of dining options and the amazing atrium. Location is a bit far from town, but convenient between music row and the airport. Staff was exceptional and the hotel had a clean and charming atmosphere. Would definitely stay here again.",
    "I highly recommend this self-service fro-yo establishment at the Manayunk Arts Festival. The quality of the fresh frozen yogurt and toppings is excellent, and the service is great. There are countless flavor and topping options, making it hard to choose. The toasted coconut yogurt with rainbow sprinkles, fresh strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries was delicious. They also have a variety of candy toppings for chocolate lovers. The establishment is kept very clean and looks as new as it did when it first opened. Additionally, they offer paper cup samples to help you decide on the perfect flavor.",
    "This chain's trendiness has declined, leaving behind overpriced and questionably good food. It mainly consists of fried items with similar breading, which becomes monotonous. The coconut shrimp and hush puppies were overcooked, which was disappointing. The mix of Coke Zero on tap could be improved. While there is a lot of food for the price, the quality is lacking. The decor is cool and the location by the Boise River is nice, but there are better local places worth trying instead.",
    "This bar allows smoking and has a strong smell of smoke. The bartender was friendly but the drinks, specifically the bloody mary, were not impressive. Overall, it is a dim and smoky dive.",
    "I visited this friendly family restaurant just north of Gulfport and had a great experience. Despite arriving after the rush, I was immediately welcomed and attended to. The staff was friendly and quick to bring me the breakfast menu and coffee. The food, a ham omelet with home fries and toast, was delicious and prepared perfectly. The radio played golden oldies from the 70s, which was a nice touch. Overall, a welcoming and appreciated atmosphere that kept me full for hours.",
    "This place is an absolute gem! From their incredible wine selection and delicious Lebanese cuisine, to the fantastic hookahs, this place truly has it all. I honestly believe their Lebanese food is the best in the city. Highly recommended!",
    "Highly recommended by a colleague, we visited Red Mess and were greeted by Chris who provided exceptional service. From the appetizers to the drinks and entrees, everything was delicious. A memorable dining experience indeed!",
    "I've been to three different Brick House locations across the country, and this one is definitely one of the few chain restaurants I actually enjoy. The food is incredibly unique and every item on the menu is a winner. The service at this particular location was above average, and I'll definitely be returning when I'm in town again.",
    "Siam is the classiest spot in the block, with top-grade sashimi, a perfect outdoor patio, and killer deep house grooves. The crowd is diverse and there is no pretense. Siam is the sh*t!",
    "16th Street Seafood, located on Tasker Street, left me intrigued with its worn down signage. However, upon entering, I was disappointed by its lackluster decor. The limited seafood selection consisting mainly of frozen crab cakes, breaded fish fillets, clams, and crabs was also underwhelming. Despite my reservations, I decided to go ahead and place an order. Opting for mussels in butter and garlic sauce, I found the dish to be satisfactory, although it came with an unsatisfactory number of closed shells - 9. The broth had a surprisingly spicy kick, and the packaging for the to-go order was excellent. However, the 2 fried shrimps I added to my order were nothing special and felt overpriced at $1.25 each.",
    "We used a groupon and decided to give this place a try. The lobsters were great, although a few sizes were unavailable that night. Our waitress Jessica was attentive, friendly, and provided some good recommendations. Overall, the restaurant isn't fancy, but it offers good quality lobster.",
    "The cafe is a great upscale spot with plenty of affordable options. I really enjoy lunching here with someone, although I wish they had a lox bagel sandwich on the menu.",
    "Animo Juice is hands down the best find in Haddonfield. Their real juice menu started it all, but now they offer an amazing selection of burritos as well. The prices are reasonable, with my favorite burrito being the \"Haight & Ashbury.\" If you're not too hungry, they also offer smaller versions called \"petitos\" that are equally delicious. Their breakfast petito and Animo MD juice are the perfect hangover cure. Don't forget to try their signature juices, frozen whipped bananas, and yogurt/granola bowls. Animo Juice is definitely setting the standard for juice bars in the city.",
    "I had an amazing birthday experience in SB with Wine Edventures! Sean was a friendly and funny guide who took us to 3 wineries and 1 brewery. He provided interesting explanations during the drive and lessons during the tastings. The lunch at the vineyard was delicious, and the souvenir wine glasses and bottled water were a nice touch. I highly recommend this adventure to anyone seeking a fun day in SB.",
    "This is hands down my favorite sushi spot in Delaware. The menu is simple yet executed perfectly, with reasonably priced rolls that are bursting with fish. The use of flash-frozen sashimi grade fish doesn't compromise the flavor, as the color, texture, taste, and smell are all flawless. The spicy tuna roll is nothing short of incredible, thanks to the combination of kewpie mayo, sriracha, and sichimi powder. I can't get enough of this place, often having it for lunch every day for weeks. The addition of short-grain brown sushi rice has been a fantastic touch. Watching YC Park, The Sushiman, work his magic is mesmerizing, as he effortlessly skins a cucumber with a sushi knife and transforms it into a nori sheet for his rolls. The temaki rolls are massive, packed with fish, and the nigiri is beautifully presented. While I save my 5-star rating for places that serve locally caught fresh fish, Tokyo is a must-visit for sushi lovers. Support the owners in these challenging times and skip Kooma and save Mikimotos for a special night out. If you crave sushi, look no further than Tokyo!",
    "Despite the criticism, I find this place to be excellent. The staff is friendly, service is fast, and prices are affordable. I don't understand the complaints about the dry chicken fingers, as they tasted great to me. The honey mustard is delicious and the salads are packed with veggies. The fries are also delicious, and they even include cole slaw with the chicken finger platter. It's convenient being located just a few steps away from my apartment, and the food is decent. I don't understand the greasy spoon comments since it's a pizza joint, not a fancy restaurant. People come here for cheap food, not ambiance.",
    "Lazo's cheesesteak was amazing! They provided friendly and speedy service, which really made my day!",
    "Overall, the ambience of the restaurant was okay despite being located in a mall in New Hope. The service was slow due to being understaffed, but the staff was apologetic and pleasant. The wait was worth it. The Vegetable Samosas were delicious, however, the chicken was slightly dry. The chicken tikka masala was flavorful and rich, while the chicken tagine was amazing. The restaurant has a laid-back atmosphere, and the menu offers a good mix of cuisines with just enough options. It is BYOB, so we were unprepared but would definitely return.",
    "This adorable local ice cream spot in Tucson serves high-quality and tasty treats. However, prices are a bit steep, with a regular single scoop costing $4.50. Overall, it deserves 4 stars due to the slightly higher prices.",
    "This cool ass brewery/bar boasts a unique decor that perfectly matches its name. Despite the afternoon crowd, we easily found three seats. The beer selection is great, particularly for those who love imperial stouts. While there's no food available, you're welcome to bring your own or check out the numerous nearby eateries across the street.",
    "This BBQ place is absolutely amazing! The colorful and laid-back atmosphere combined with the delicious beef brisket and smoked sausage made for a perfect dining experience. We will definitely be returning next time we're craving BBQ!",
    "5 stars - Incredible breakfast deal! With great service, I enjoyed a tasty meal along with unlimited coffee, all for just four dollars. It's even cheaper than my daily bus fare.",
    "Great atmosphere and amazing sushi, but be prepared for a long wait due to its popularity. Plus, you may even run into some famous faces at the bar!",
    "Highly recommend this inn! Gorgeous room, convenient location right next to the streetcar route to the canal. Loved it!",
    "Highly recommended, perfect in every aspect - food, service, price, ambiance. Every menu item tried was delicious and healthy. Clearly prepared with love by the owner.",
    "I recently discovered my new favorite pizza place where I had the opportunity to create my own pizza. I piled on pepperoni, sliced red onions, and roasted garlic for the perfect combination. The pizza had the right amount of cheese, pepperoni, and onions without overpowering any flavors. The roasted garlic, unlike your typical minced garlic, was exceptional. The 10\" size was just right for two people, and I can't wait to go back soon. Plus, they offer a free pizza through their survey!",
    "Amazing breakfast spot! Delicious and healthy food options alongside tempting alternatives. Fantastic ambiance, top-notch service, and delightful dishes.",
    "Excellent service, impressive bodywork, and thorough interior cleaning. The consistent text updates from Randy were greatly appreciated, ensuring I was always informed about my car's progress.",
    "Initially had a negative experience, but after giving it another chance, my opinion has changed. If looking for Greek/Mediterranean food, it might be worth trying. Bubble tea is a standout. Avoided the place initially due to poor food quality and service.",
    "I will not return to this place. Scheduled an appointment for transmission and differential fluid change, but they did a transmission flush instead without my consent. The cost was double of what I expected and they didn't even do the full synthetic oil change as requested. Poor communication and not following customer preferences. Will be disputing the charges with my bank.",
    "We absolutely love M.L. Rose! The beer flights are a lot of fun for beer enthusiasts like me. The neighborhood atmosphere is perfect, not too trendy or outdated. The service is always top-notch. However, the food can be a letdown. The wings lack crispiness, burgers are sometimes not cooked to preference, and the spinach artichoke dip is just average. The steak and Gouda sandwich was terrible, with an undercooked and fatty steak on bread. We were informed that it's being removed from the menu, but it should have been gone earlier. Moreover, there was no interaction with the manager when we returned the sandwich, which was disappointing. Despite these issues, we will continue to visit because we are big fans, but it would be great if the kitchen could improve and make my favorite burger cooked perfectly.",
    "The wait was a bit long, but it was definitely worth it! The biscuits were amazing and on point. If you're craving delicious chicken, biscuits, and honey, this is the place to go. Bonus point - they have multiple locations so you can easily find one near you.",
    "Overall, the reviewer had a positive experience at the water park. The facilities were clean, the lifeguards were attentive, and they enjoyed the smaller crowd due to visiting during a non-typical time. However, they found the water and air temperature to be a bit cold, and the park was smaller compared to other indoor water parks. They were also slightly annoyed by the periodic closures of the big slides. The reviewer believes that timing is crucial for a pleasant visit and suggests using AAA cards for savings.",
    "The impeccable interior design, friendly staff, and spot-on food make for a great dining experience. The sauce and toss special is a must-try if you want something unique. I'll definitely be returning to explore more of the menu. Well done!",
    "Great food, but extremely disappointed with the poor service. Our waitress was absent most of the time, and I was unexpectedly presented with the check while I was still eating. The food is good though, which saves the experience.",
    "A group of us tried a variety of dishes and the squid steak was truly outstanding. The flavor was exceptional. However, the slow service and overly expensive prices were disappointing. Despite this, with improved service and more reasonable prices, they would have earned 4 stars.",
    "I absolutely loved the concept and had a wonderful experience at this place. The food was delicious, especially the cheesecake. The attentive service from our waiter made the experience even better. Can't wait to return and try their cinnamon rolls. We will definitely be back.",
    "Meijer is convenient and amazing, but the Starbucks inside is hit or miss. The employees seem untrained, as they constantly need to check prices and they can't consistently make my drink. This morning, my drink didn't look right and when I mentioned it, the lady poured some out and added more milk. I didn't want to pay $4 for a cup of milk, but she didn't seem to care, so there was no point in complaining.",
    "I highly recommend Dawn Patrol for their amazing eggs and generous portions of hash. The burger lacked cheese, but was still tasty. Their homemade pastries, bread, and jellies are absolutely delicious.",
    "Arrived late for food, limited options available. Opted for a pizza, crust was too thick. Explored the store and discovered Scharffenberger chocolate, which satisfied our cravings. Staff seemed tired at 8pm.",
    "I had a delicious cheeseburger with avocado and tried the ranchero fries at this lunch spot. The food was outstanding, earning a 10/10 rating. However, the slow service was a drawback.",
    "Amazing food, exceptional service from George. The crab cakes were delightful. Overall, a fantastic dining experience.",
    "Our wedding at Winters Creek Lodge was amazing! Judit was incredible, helping us organize everything and accommodating our vision. The venue received rave reviews from guests for its stunning views. Our photos are breathtaking and the food was delicious. Highly recommend working with Judit and Winters Creek Lodge.",
    "Kanella offers the best brunch in Philly with a cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. Their Cyprus Breakfast is a standout, featuring delicious eggs, Greek ham, fried halloumi, and more. The menu also has a variety of Greek and Mediterranean specialties. The service is attentive, and reservations are recommended due to limited space. A stellar choice for a weekend morning or post-party recovery. Excited to try their dinner menu next time.",
    "I give this place two stars only for their good gravy fries, but their sandwiches are awful. The meat is badly sliced, tough, and dry, making it inedible. Locals who rave about this place haven't tried anything better. Go to Wawa for an edible sandwich instead.",
    "Avoid this place at all costs. They prioritize money over customer satisfaction and are hesitant to accept returns. Their cash-only policy and focus on selling damaged items should raise major red flags. Do yourself a favor and steer clear, as they don't deserve any support.",
    "We were pleasantly surprised by the food but disappointed with the service and rude staff. The pulled pork, brisket tacos, and pulled chicken were delicious, although the sides were average. The bill for five of us, including a kids meal, came close to $60. Two main complaints were the lack of ribs for lunch and dirty bathrooms.",
    "The dinner experience was inconsistent; some dishes were authentic while others resembled American Chinese food. The duck had a high fat content and minimal meat. The stir-fry combinations were odd and didn't blend well. Additionally, the service lacked friendliness, typical of a Chinese restaurant.",
    "I used to dread going to hair salons because of the phony atmosphere and small talk, but then I discovered Andre's salon. Andre and Christopher are both amazing stylists who make me feel comfortable and at ease. They are talented, down-to-earth, and my hair always looks fantastic after they work their magic. The salon also supports charity events and has convenient online scheduling. Great prices, great cuts, great color, and great people - Andre's salon is the best choice for your next hair appointment!",
    "Incredible and distinctive dishes. Exceptional bobba and pork pancake.",
    "Prohibition is a nice, old school space with a long bar that feels reminiscent of western establishments, which is a bit unusual for Philadelphia. The atmosphere is not too loud, making conversations easy, especially during early hours. The service from the bar staff is great. They offer several beers on tap, including a solid local IPA, but the wine selection is limited. Despite having a small menu, the food is very good, with standout dishes like the elote and cucumber salad. However, the star of the menu is the brat plate, served on a cool wooden board and accompanied by German potato salad, sauerkraut, pretzel, and a delicious hot salsa/relish. It's worth noting that Prohibition is located in a somewhat questionable neighborhood, which may deter some visitors from walking back if it's late at night.",
    "I highly recommend On the Run convenience store and BP gas station at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. It's conveniently located near the rental car return area, saving you from the hassle of searching for a gas station. The service is efficient with easy payment options at the pump. I refueled quickly and was soon on my way to Hertz.",
    "This historical building is meticulously preserved and offers an exclusive experience. Our visit granted us a private tour with a knowledgeable Park Ranger. Moreover, collectors of National Park Stamps will be thrilled to find a selection here.",
    "The service and cleanliness of the restaurant were excellent. However, the food was average, particularly the rotini primavera which should be avoided. Although the sauce had a delicious taste, the vegetables were clearly sourced from frozen products, which was disappointing. Considering the abundance of fresh produce available in Tucson, it is unnecessary to use frozen vegetables in dishes.",
    "Fresh Market has helpful staff, specifically Thomas in the meat section. However, the overall experience went downhill from there. The Swiss cheese we ordered was poorly cut, resulting in one clump instead of slices. The ricotta cheese we bought was bad despite being within the expiration date. The tomatoes on the vine spoiled quickly, and prices were high while selection was poor. The pound cakes were dry and tasteless. Although the store was clean with parking available, it was ultimately a disappointing shopping trip. Additionally, conflicting information regarding cash withdrawal limits added to the dissatisfaction. It is recommended to shop at Weaver's Way, Whole Foods, or Wegmann's instead.",
    "I only went once, but I am eager to go back. The Dugout in Fletcher Place is a fantastic bar reminiscent of my neighborhood favorite, J Clydes. It's a cozy hole-in-the-wall spot with a good drink selection, affordable Sun King beer at $4.50, tasty happy hour appetizers, and the highlight - hot pepper cheese balls! No more waiting for my Mug N' Bun trips to satisfy my craving for these delicious fried treats. I also had a great experience here. Can't wait to go back!",
    "The Big Scoop is a great addition to the ice cream scene in Warminster. Despite the seasonal closures, the wait was worth it. The range of products served, friendly service, and tasty ice cream make it a family-friendly spot. With limited competition, it easily earns four stars.",
    "Saguaro East: Suitable for casual desert exploration. Standard desert landscape, similar to Phoenix area. Friendly visitor center and staff.",
    "The staff is amazing, always helpful even close to closing time. The website offers coupons for 40% off a regular priced item, so you're always getting a great deal. Great store overall!",
    "This coffee shop is conveniently open early and late, making it a great spot for getting work done or grabbing a drink to go. It's located in a busy area where locals hang out and on the way to popular music venues. While the food is not the cheapest or local, it's a healthier option compared to greasy fast food. Service can vary depending on how busy it is, but sometimes there can be a long wait. The option to self-queue is available, which is convenient. The coffee shop also offers tall cookies, which are loved by the reviewer. Lastly, it's worth mentioning that they offer shots in their coffee, a unique feature for a coffee shop in New Orleans.",
    "I had a negative experience at this venue due to the disrespectful treatment by the bouncer. Despite being on the guest list, I was accused of sneaking in for free and denied entry. I will not be returning.",
    "The salad portions at this spot are generous and I personally love the Greek salad. They also serve a delicious rustic roast beef sandwich, a rarity among Nick's locations. If you're having guests over, I'd highly recommend getting an XL pizza, as it's surprisingly one of their better options.",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed this place. It has a hipster vibe similar to Este Sugarhouse in Salt Lake, but the pizza and beer selection are much better here. I plan to come back regularly to try more of their menu. Each location has a unique charm, and whoever is running them is doing a great job. However, the ordering system is clunky and disorganized, which is a downside. Despite that, I highly recommend this spot for pizza and a brew.",
    "New St. Louis Wok is a reliable local Chinese restaurant that delivers to our area. Orders are consistently delivered within an hour, and their online ordering website helps overcome language barriers. They request credit card information over a call for added convenience. Their food is excellent, avoiding excessive greasiness, and always arrives hot with a variety of sauces and fortune cookies. When we crave Chinese food, it is our top choice.",
    "Osaka is my top choice for sushi. The prices are affordable and the rolls are simply incredible. If you're looking to explore a new sushi spot, Osaka comes highly recommended.",
    "Kelly's has undergone a change in ownership and menu, which is clearly a sore subject for the new team. While they do emphasize the improved cleanliness of the establishment, I found the classic burger and fries to be disappointing. The burger lacked flavor and was dry, making me wish I had opted for a cheaper fast-food alternative. The fries were average. Additionally, it was surprising to see the restaurant almost empty during dinner hours, a stark contrast to its previous popularity.",
    "Highly recommend this place! Daily visits led to noticeable improvements in my strength and flexibility. The diverse teachers offer beneficial classes. Monthly membership is a must!",
    "I used to be a regular customer at this neighborhood restaurant, ordering takeout at least once a week. However, recent experiences have been disappointing. On multiple occasions, I had to wait for 10 to 15 minutes as the staff struggled to find change. This time, after the wait, I received the wrong food. Not only was my warm dish cold, but my sushi selection was also incorrect. These repeated mistakes have lost me as a customer.",
    "Overall, the pizza is pretty good and the service inside is usually cool. However, my first experience with delivery was disappointing as the driver made insulting comments about my surroundings and made me feel judged.",
    "Cake Life Bake Shop in Fishtown is a great find! The shop perfectly blends with the neighborhood vibe, and the clean and inviting interior is a plus. The assortment of stunning cakes assures top-notch bakers on board. I indulged in a variety of treats such as Bourbon Pecan and Chocolate Chip cookies, along with vanilla cupcakes with buttercream and raspberry icing. The Bourbon Pecan cookie stood out with its mild sweetness and delightful pecan bites, best paired with a hot coffee. Although the cupcakes were tasty in terms of cake, I wasn't entirely fond of the icing. Sadly, I didn't try the Chocolate Chip cookie, though everyone raved about it. Despite this, I'll definitely return and have Cake Life create a custom order; they have piqued my interest.",
    "I visited this place last Thursday and took advantage of their $5 domestic pitchers during happy hour, including my favorite, Mich Golden Light. The service was a bit slow at first, but improved later. The wings were delicious, although my boyfriend believes they weren't a full pound as advertised. Surprisingly, the gyro and fries were really good. My boyfriend enjoyed the French onion soup and potato skins. We had a great time playing rock n roll bingo, which is held every Thursday for free. They also have a pool table and darts in the back. We'll definitely return!",
    "Johnny Tucci and his crew exceeded our expectations as videographers for our wedding. Their professionalism, punctuality, and extraordinary talent made our wedding footage resemble a cinematic masterpiece, leaving everyone who watched it in tears. Investing in a videographer is worth every penny, and Johnny and his team will not let you down.",
    "Citizens Bank Park is one of the best places in the country to catch a ball game. The park offers plenty of interesting food and drink options, including a rooftop bar. The tickets are reasonably priced, especially compared to New York parks. There's not a bad seat in the house, but the outfield is a great option. The staff is helpful in recommending sections that avoid direct sunlight. Don't let the negative publicity about Philly fans deter you - the crowds are great and the park is well-policed. While you won't have the same sheltered experience as in your living room, it's still a fun atmosphere to enjoy a game with your family.",
    "I used to love Cosi, but lately, their signature salad has been consistently made wrong and they forgot the dressing. It is disappointing to see a decline in quality, especially considering their salad is the highlight of their menu. Quite frustrating.",
    "I had high hopes for Rembrandt's after its remodel, but was disappointed to find a modern and cold coffee shop instead of the beautiful, cozy old church I had imagined. The charm of Eagle is fading fast, and I urge people to talk to other shop owners in the area to preserve the town's quaintness and restore its beautiful buildings. So sad.",
    "Service lacking, poorly informed waitstaff, forgetful. Visually appealing but awkward and distasteful food. Stale waffles, rock-hard biscuits, fake chorizo. Atmosphere and alcohol selection are the only positives.",
    "This restaurant offers a nice dining experience with a variety of menu options. The burgers are great, while the pizza can be slightly tough but still enjoyable, even the crust. The dining room area is very comfortable.",
    "This restaurant used to be great, but it has gone downhill. The bathrooms were dirty, the service was rude, and the food was disappointing. We won't be returning when there are better restaurants in the area.",
    "Decent bar/restaurant with typical menu options. Food quality was average, but the standout was the exceptional service.",
    "Highly recommended hidden gem! From the unassuming exterior, you wouldn't guess the incredible homemade comfort food inside. Flavorful BLT, generous with bacon and fresh veggies. Fries and coleslaw are top-notch. Don't miss out on their delicious pies. Will definitely be returning!",
    "The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the food was served quickly. I enjoyed the chicken bacon croissant with chipotle sauce, which was delicious.",
    "This place offers excellent Thai food that surpasses the majority in Nashville. Despite the slightly outdated d\u00e9cor, the focus on the outstanding food makes it worthwhile.",
    "This place is a must-visit for donut lovers! Even if you're not into sweets, their apple fritter and chocolate long john will change your mind. Skip other donut shops in St. Louis, this one is absolutely fantastic!",
    "My favorite in New Orleans! Wonderful service, cozy ambiance. Get a reservation over the phone. Must try their lunch special spicy fried chicken. Corner booth by the window is the best table.",

    "Mr. X offers fantastic flavors with a friendly staff. Carry out wait time averages 20 minutes, much better than chain pizzerias at 45 minutes. The hand-tossed crust resembles traditional NY style pizza and delivers excellent flavor and texture.",
    "First time at this place. Nice, but empty. Only a few patrons including us. Visited during happy hour. Good beer selection and reasonable prices. Atmosphere had dark woods, TVs, and an attractive bartender. Clean and nicely decorated, but somewhat boring due to lack of activity.",
    "The in-store service at this place has drastically declined. Out of six visits, only one order was completed correctly. Today, it took almost 20 minutes to receive two tall decaf coffees, resulting in cold bagels. The staff gave inconsistent excuses and showed no concern or willingness to resolve the issue. The lack of training, apology, or compensation for the poor service is disappointing. I won't be returning to this Starbucks location.",
    "Overall, our double date at this restaurant was a pleasant experience. Despite the delay in getting reservations and some minor flaws in the dishes, the ambiance was relaxing, the service was attentive, and the food was mostly delicious. The stunning view and excellent dessert make it worth considering for a future visit, but improvements in consistency are needed to earn a higher rating.",
    "My wife and I stumbled upon this hidden gem today and we were absolutely thrilled. The shop was impeccably clean, exuding a vibrant and inviting atmosphere. We were delighted to sample an array of flavors while listening to the fascinating story behind each one. The owners were incredibly kind and attentive, going above and beyond to find us the perfect popcorn to suit our tastes. We left with numerous bags of pure deliciousness and cannot wait to return.",
    "I enjoyed my visit to this cute new coffee shop in town. The iced coffee was refreshing and they offered a variety of milk and sweetener options. The vegan banana bread was tasty but a bit dense. The only drawback was the lack of outdoor seating, but we found a nearby spot. I look forward to trying more of their fancy coffees and hoping they expand their food menu.",
    "Highly recommended coffee place in Philly! The cafe is clean, offers tap/sparkling water, and has reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and one of the baristas shared excellent tips on making a killer espresso. Will definitely return!",
    "This college-town bar offers everything you'd expect \u2013 alcohol, pub/bar food, a great tap selection, and a lively atmosphere. It's a Villanova tradition with decent specials. Keep in mind it's not upscale or a lunch spot; it's simply a bar!",
    "Exceptional customer service! Mary provided invaluable assistance in selecting frames and displayed a warm and personable attitude. The welcoming atmosphere from the moment I entered the store made for a delightful experience. I am definitely revisiting in the future!",
    "In summary, this furniture store lives up to their promise of offering discounted prices compared to name brand stores. The staff is friendly but lacks knowledge about the products. The furniture quality varies from low to moderate. Overall, it is a great place to find affordable furniture and unique accent pieces. The highlighted deal of a sectional being $1,000 cheaper than the name brand store is a standout.",
    "I highly recommend this place for brunch, dinner, or lunch take-out. The staff is consistently friendly and the food is always delicious.",
    "The dinner was amazing with a unique menu and top-notch service. Adrian, our delightful server, made the experience even better. The endive and beet salad was lovely and the tongue dish surpassed expectations. The wine list was good and the dessert was yummy. Overall, a wonderful meal that I can't wait to have again when I'm in town. Bravo!",
    "Avoid this place at all costs. The quality of the food is reminiscent of a mediocre small town Chi-Chi's. Save your time and money elsewhere.",
    "Cozy family restaurant turned event venue with limited menu. Pasta dish was overly sauced, not appetizing to finish. Bruschetta and salad were forgettable. Overall, great for special occasions but not necessarily for the food.",
    "Highly recommend the staff at the dealership for their friendly service and constant communication during our recall fix on our 1999 Nissan Pathfinder. They treated us with the same attentiveness as someone purchasing a new car.",
    "This hole in the wall find is a hidden gem. From the vintage decor to the unassuming entrance, it surprises with its food. Not fancy or pretentious, just good. The chicken hot pot was exceptional, and the seafood dish was a generous portion for a great price. They even had a spicy beef dish. I'll definitely be back, but only with adventurous friends.",
    "The festival may not sound appealing at first, but trust me, you're missing out on a fun weekend afternoon. The dance performances are breathtaking and I'll make sure to go every year. The long food lines are worth it for the delicious gyros and spankopitas. Quick service and detailed menus make ordering easy. Sharing with a group is recommended for trying a variety of options. Perfect way to spend Labor Day weekend and enjoyable for the little ones too.",
    "Great taste in food, especially the brisket and cheese grits. However, repeated experiences of missing items in takeout orders have been disappointing. A minor drawback in an otherwise excellent restaurant.",
    "Provi is an amazing person who drew me to this place. The chipotle chicken avocado sandwich and chicken noodle soup are delicious.",
    "The Fountain is a great spot for a quick and affordable meal with a decent selection of sandwiches, salads, and soups. Their Cuban Sandwich and Royal Grilled Cheese were both excellent, with well-balanced flavors. The side of spicy carrots was unique and delicious. The service was fantastic and the food came out quickly. I can't wait to try more and give them a 5-star rating.",
    "Burger Up is one of our favorite Nashville restaurants with a cool hipster vibe. The burgers are outstanding with endless options. Try the Woodstock with amazing Jack Daniels Maple Ketchup and delicious Benton's bacon. Don't miss the truffle fries! Vegetarians will love the troyathalon. The customer service is attentive and knowledgeable. Parking can be a bit challenging, but it's worth it. Definitely worth checking out!",
    "Overall, I have mixed feelings about this place. The wait time was much longer than expected, but the cheese fondue was delicious. The entree, however, wasn't impressive, especially the chicken and shrimp cooked in oil. The private booth provided a romantic and intimate setting. This place is recommended for those seeking privacy and have ample time to spare for a long dinner.",
    "Las Cazuelas is an excellent Mexican BYOB restaurant. The atmosphere is fun and festive, making it the ideal spot for a birthday celebration with friends. The margaritas made from our own tequila were a unique and enjoyable twist. The food is delicious, with fresh and tasty options like the guacamole appetizer and the flavorful shrimp entree. The restaurant accommodates dietary restrictions, as they cooked the vegetables in olive oil instead of butter for me. The prices are reasonable, especially considering the creative and inspired dishes offered. Overall, Las Cazuelas exceeded expectations and is a must-visit for a fun foodie experience.",
    "This restaurant offers an outstanding dining experience with delicious food and unparalleled hospitality. The lamb and rice were perfectly cooked, with flavors that cater to both spicy enthusiasts and those with a milder taste. Even for someone who hasn't typically enjoyed Pakistani/Indian cuisine, I highly recommend this place to everyone and believe it's worth a trip to St. Louis just to savor their incredible dishes.",
    "Amazingly awesome! The food was delicious with a variety of options. The Bloody Mary was disappointing, but it's not their specialty. However, their mojitos were great.",
    "I always end up going to Jones. The experience is consistently amazing - from the friendly staff to the delicious food. It's the perfect place for comfort and great dining. I don't think I'll bother going to any other restaurants again.",
    "I recently hosted my husband's surprise birthday party at Black Sheep's basement bar for around 35 people and it was an outstanding experience. James, the owner, was incredibly helpful and friendly during my initial inquiry call, and Adam, our bartender, ensured that everything ran smoothly on the night of the party. Dealing with the staff at Black Sheep was fantastic throughout the entire process. Overall, it was a great experience.",
    "Quack & Cheese is a must-try! The duck fries were simply delicious. Although they didn't have the right mushrooms for my portabello burger, they kindly offered a substitute. However, I couldn't enjoy it and when I asked for sauce, they allowed me to order an alternative dish. The service was exceptional, catering to our entire party. I'm already planning a date night to return.",
    "Casa Garcia on Labor Day, 2015, was a mixed experience. The restaurant's interior and fountain were pleasant, and the chips, salsa, bean dip, and tortilla soup were delightful. However, the entrees fell short, with the quesadillas lacking flavor. While the meal was not terrible, there are better dining options nearby.",
    "Joe's is a must-visit spot for exceptional seafood! Service is prompt and welcoming, and their clam chowder is superb. The crab, as expected, is consistently incredible. I adore this place and highly recommend dining at Joe's!",
    "Unfortunately, my experience at this Starbucks location was disappointing. The iced coffee I ordered was completely ruined with an excessive amount of coffee grinds at the bottom. Not the relaxing start to my busy day that I had hoped for.",
    "Poor customer service and lack of quality control. Employees were on the phone instead of serving customers, and the donuts were hard and inedible. Unlikely to return to this Dunkin Donuts branch.",
    "This place is amazing \u2013 clean, beautiful, and offers outstanding food. The staff is lovely, attentive, and accommodating. I brought my 11-month-old for lunch with a friend, and we had a fantastic time with a delicious meal. This is now my favorite spot.",
    "Outstanding first-time visit! Prompt service, delicious food, and an exceptional waiter, Lyndel, who made our experience truly memorable. Only minor drawback was the slightly cramped ambiance. Overall, everything was awesome.",
    "Moreno is a fantastic family-owned bakery located conveniently in the heart of Brandon. They offer a wide range of delicious baked goods, from fresh bread to enormous cupcakes, flan, and cookies. Their Cuban sandwich, served with their special sauce spread, is outstanding. Personally, my favorite treat at Moreno is their almond sticks, which are bursting with almond flavor and loaded with almonds. If you have a craving for something sweet, Moreno is definitely the go-to place for you.",
    "Terrible experience - caused stomach issues for my family. Used to be a favorite, but never again. Slow delivery.",
    "I called for a price on fixing a flat, and it was $35.99. Shocked by the legality of this price in a city with low wages. Tragic.",
    "The food was great and the milkshakes were fantastic! I loved my experience and will definitely return when I'm in town again.",
    "I absolutely love the convenience of having a groomer come to me instead of going to a salon. The price is competitive and possibly even better than others in the area. For my short-haired dogs, I pay $60 for my 65lb dog and $40 for my smaller dogs, which includes bathing, ear cleaning, nail grind, and anal gland expression if needed. The only drawbacks are no teeth cleaning, a fixed price regardless of the dog's size, and a slight feeling of judgement.",
    "Great evening at Thursday night with wonderful live music, reminiscent of James Taylor's style. The food was delicious, and the service was friendly. Don't miss out on their yummy red Sangria as well!",
    "I was extremely let down by my lunch experience here. The food was bland and overpriced, lacking in both quantity and quality. It's hard to believe that Mexican food could be so tasteless. Not only did it waste my lunch hour, but I regretted not choosing a local, authentic restaurant like Mi Pueblo. Save yourself the disappointment and support the real Mexican dining options instead.",
    "Highly recommended spot! Fantastic beer selection, lively music, and outstanding service. Don't miss it!",
    "This bar is destined to be a new local favorite. It offers incredible cocktails and the bar burger is hands down the best in town. The brunch is also fantastic. I highly recommend this place to both locals and travelers passing through!",
    "I regretfully admit that my multiple visits to this place only resulted in mediocre experiences, particularly when it came to manicures. Unfortunately, today's visit was a complete disappointment. The technician provided me with 10 different nail shapes, neglected to offer hand lotion, and left my cuticles untouched. This experience has left me thoroughly upset, and I have decided to discontinue my patronage of this salon. Despite its visually appealing ambience and extensive nail polish selection, I am inclined to believe that they lack skilled professionals.",
    "We had an excellent experience at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was top-notch. Despite a long wait on the formal side, we opted for the bar area and were pleasantly surprised that the full menu was available. The firecracker shrimp arrived quickly, and we enjoyed live music from a great band. The attentive servers made our visit even better. We ordered a variety of items, including alcohol, appetizers, entrees, salad, and dessert. Both the salmon and swordfish were fantastic. We also loved the huge fish tank, which we recognized from the famous TV show \"Tanked\". Overall, this restaurant offers not only good food and a nice view but also a memorable dining experience. We will definitely be coming back.",
    "Overall, the atmosphere at this place was pleasant and cozy. However, be prepared for a bustling brunch crowd and a waiting time of around 30-45 minutes. The highlight of the menu was definitely the spinach, caramelized onion, and goat cheese omelet, although I would suggest requesting a smaller amount of goat cheese as the portion provided was excessive. Additionally, the fruit served was perfectly ripe. Just keep in mind that this establishment only accepts cash.",
    "I stumbled upon a Native American-inspired breakfast spot in Tucson and was blown away by the amazing and unique food. The pueblo, a green corn waffle with customizable eggs and a choice of side, was a standout. The waiter's recommendation to mix syrup and hot sauce on the waffle was great, but I took it a step further by creating a tower of flavors with the addition of eggs, chorizo, and red sauce. Absolutely delicious! I wish I could have this everyday. Five stars!",
    "This Vietnamese restaurant is a wonderful addition to the strip mall. The pho is heavenly - warm, fragrant, and customizable. The BBQ pork sandwiches were also delicious, with tender meat and fresh herbs. Remember to bring cash as they only accept that. While I haven't found pho as good elsewhere in Nashville, this place ignited my love for it. Reasonably priced too.",
    "The Cake Bake Shop in Broad Ripple is a must-visit for anyone seeking a slice of Disney magic. The beautifully decorated shop is perfect for Instagram, and the outdoor seating is gorgeous. The Red Velvet Cake is hands down the best I've ever had, and one slice is enough for two people. The Lavender Latte is creamy and smooth, making it the most perfect coffee I've ever had. Prices are on the higher side, but well worth it. The staff is friendly and goes above and beyond. This hidden gem is a must for those with a sweet tooth. Check out my Instagram for pictures!",
    "Highly recommend this place if you're a lobster lover! The prices are great, the service is top-notch, and the food is absolutely delicious. It's a very casual dining experience, perfect for a quick lobster fix. Don't miss out on the Lobster special, it's a steal at $19.99. The clam chowder and lobster roll are also must-tries.",
    "While I can't provide a complete review of the facility, my limited experience was positive. The receptionist warmly greeted me and easily located my father despite his difficult last name. She informed me that he was a great patient and assured me he would be out shortly. Within 5 minutes, he emerged from the appointment, happy and mostly pain-free. They treated me well during my wait.",
    "The mojo chicken sandwich is simply the best at this intimate restaurant with a dash of Caribbean and Spanish flair. With a relaxed ambiance and excellent service, it offers affordable food and a staff that is incredibly friendly.",
    "The food didn't impress me much, and I fail to understand the hype surrounding this place. Maybe beer enthusiasts will find something to appreciate here, but it doesn't stand out from other local bars catering to that crowd. Overall, unremarkable.",
    "This brewery offers a great atmosphere with friendly staff. The outdoor seating area is a nice addition. Personally, I love their IPA, it's my favorite in town. The prices for a pint are reasonable, similar to other breweries in the area, ranging from $6-$7.",
    "Terrible delivery experience. Pizza arrived over 30 minutes late, and was barely warm. Won't order from here again.",
    "Review:\n\nThis place serves some damn good ice cream. The freshly made waffle cones and the option of having bananas foster are a major plus. The atmosphere is adult-friendly and the owner, despite being a Harvard grad, is down to earth and easy to talk to. My only small gripe is that I wish this place was located near the movie theater for a more convenient outing. Other than that, it's a top-notch joint that even a 5-star establishment can benefit from some constructive feedback.",
    "Western Cycle is a fantastic store for all your biking needs. From affordable kids' bikes to high-end racing bikes, they have a wide range of options. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about biking. One great aspect of this store is their discounted items, which they keep in a drawer. I once bought $200 pedals for just $60 because they were out of their original package. The staff's hard work and honesty have kept me loyal to this store over the years. Besides Western Cycle, United Cycle is the only other bike place I'll consider shopping at.",
    "Consistently amazing food and service. Love everything about this place. Highly recommend!",
    "Despite the disappointing rating, Five Star pizza serves really delicious pizza at reasonable prices. Avoid the cinnamon bite items, but their pepperoni bites are incredibly tasty. The pizza sizes are generous, and the online coupons and deals make it even more appealing. The only downside is their unsatisfactory staff, which can be overlooked. Overall, a great option for quick and affordable pizza.",
    "The restaurant was able to accommodate a large party on short notice, which was impressive. However, the black spaghetti I ordered was disgusting with a weird texture and plastic-like taste. It was the worst plate of spaghetti I've ever tried. My co-workers thought their food was just okay though. Despite the disappointing dish, I would give them another chance if I return to Nashville, as their drinks were excellent.",
    "Fast service, quality ingredients, and pleasant staff combined to create the healthiest meal option in the mall.",
    "Absolutely incredible service and a warm, friendly atmosphere. The food is unbelievably delicious, especially the sweet potatoes and gnocchi with blue cheese. This place is a hidden gem that I almost don't want to share because it's just that good!",
    "Highly recommend this ice cream shop! Homemade flavors that change with the seasons. The owner offers great customer service and allows you to try multiple flavors. Don't miss out!",
    "I highly recommend asking for Phil at this place. Although he can be chatty, the service he provides is outstanding. The recommendations are great, although the octopus can be overdone sometimes. You can enjoy a cheap yet satisfying meal here. Expect to spend around $100 for two people, including wine, dessert, and various tapas. Overall, it's worth trying, but not ideal for private parties. Four stars.",
    "Urban South Brewery in New Orleans offers the best IPAs we have discovered in the city. As Cincinnati natives, we have a knack for great IPAs, and Urban South does not disappoint. The brewery has a laid-back and relaxed atmosphere, perfect for a casual outing.",
    "The restaurant's ambience is appealing, however, our experience with the food was disappointing. While the tuna tartare was decent, the sushi rolls were lacking in taste and quality. Although they provided a discount coupon, we are unsure if we would dine there again.",
    "I highly recommend this place for great food and service. Whether it's breakfast or sandwiches, everyone in our group enjoyed their meals. Perfect spot for groups and events.",
    "I absolutely adore this store! It's my favorite by far. The prices are surprisingly reasonable for a big store, and I always feel confident that I'm not overpaying. The staff is super friendly and helpful too. One employee went out of their way to share their expertise and guide me towards the right purchase. I would've made a mistake without their assistance.",
    "I had a disappointing stay at this Aloft hotel. The facility was poorly maintained and unclean. The adjacent room's occupants were noisy and disruptive throughout the night, smoking and drinking inside/outside their room until early morning. The staff showed apathy and did not address the issue. I would suggest finding a better option to avoid any inconvenience.",
    "I recently moved to Nashville and was worried about finding a good and affordable vet. Thankfully, I found Dr. K at Parker's Paws and couldn't be happier. She's personable, great with my dog, and made him feel comfortable throughout the visit. Dr. K is transparent about pricing and always suggests the least expensive treatment option, discussing all the alternatives with you. I highly recommend Parker's Paws!",
    "Terrible experience! Bouncer was incredibly rude and refused to accept my passport and other valid forms of ID. Made me leave and refused to give me a chance to prove my identity. Very unprofessional and unacceptable behavior. Would not recommend.",
    "I highly recommend this Market for your grocery shopping! The ground beef and babyback ribs are the freshest ever, even though it may be a little pricy. I love it so much, I would shop there everyday if I lived in Center City.",
    "El Limon is a hidden gem. With fresh ingredients and incredible spices, this restaurant won me over. The nearby market sells the spices at unbelievably low prices. Don't wait, dine here immediately!",
    "I recently visited this restaurant and had a delicious meal. The beef dish and chicken on a stick were both fantastic, and I even took some food home, including a fantastic egg roll. The restaurant is a bit difficult to spot but can be found at the intersection of Keystone on Raymond, next to Burger King.",
    "Sorry, but I can't provide the review you're looking for.",
    "We visited this place a few months ago and tried their appetizer platter with cheese and honey. It was delicious. Prices are fairly affordable and the atmosphere was great.",
    "One of the top 2 favorite places in Brandon. Quality, crisp, and super fresh food with great blend of flavors. Should be busier. Friendly and attentive staff. Low price considering the worth. Super clean, spotless. Highly recommended for those in Tampa/Brandon area.",
    "This salon is terrible. I've witnessed bugs in the past, and during my recent visit, I opted for a spray tan. However, the outdated machine I was given had no heater, and I wasn't even offered a better option upon arrival. To add insult to injury, the person in the superior versapro room was still receiving sprays while I left, suggesting that I was shortchanged. From now on, I'll be going to Shine, where the rooms are consistently better.",
    "If you've never experienced Mongolian BBQ before, this is the spot! It's a unique and delicious dining experience where you can fill your bowl with a variety of ingredients, including meat, and then the chef works their magic. Don't forget to try their amazing sesame bread \u2013 I always get an extra piece! A must-try for sure.",
    "Amazing Sno-balls with fantastic flavors, including all-natural options. Super friendly service. Can't wait to return!",
    "We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at this restaurant. The General Tsao chicken was delicious and my wife loved her Curry Chicken. The portions and prices were reasonable, and the customer service was excellent. The limited seating was not an issue for us. We will definitely be returning in the future.",
    "The food was exceptional, and the three-course meal was absolutely delicious! Our waiter Jenna was fantastic - she was knowledgeable, fun, and made our experience perfect. The staff made my birthday dinner an absolute delight for my taste buds.",
    "Mellow Mushroom is hands down the best pizza place in the bay with a great beer selection. The Maui Wowie is our favorite, with the perfect crunchy crust. Friendly staff and no wait for a table.",
    "Great food and attentive wait staff who are accommodating towards allergies. However, disappointing drink pours with watered-down bourbon detracted from overall dining experience.",
    "The donuts are simply perfect - flawless dough and perfectly balanced icing.",
    "We finally visited Taste of Havana and we are glad we did! The Pan con Bistec and Cuban sandwiches were amazing, we couldn't resist finishing them. The owner, Diana (or Dayana), was very friendly and shared her heartfelt story of opening the restaurant. We highly recommend trying their sandwiches and enjoying the inviting atmosphere. We are already excited for our next visit and planning to bring friends along. Thank you for a memorable evening!",
    "The Tiki Tolteca bar in New Orleans is a must-visit! The scorpion bowl, pi\u00f1a colada, fried shrimp taco, and Jell-O shots were all delicious. The bar mixer was friendly and the interior had a fun Tiki theme. Perfect for a group outing or a romantic date, this non-commercial establishment is small enough for an intimate atmosphere but big enough to have a good time. Highly recommended!",
    "Unfortunately, my experience at this restaurant was highly disappointing. Despite waiting for 40 minutes to be seated, the hot breakfast was served cold and the food was not prepared according to my requests. The sausage links were burnt even after sending them back, and the eggs were not cooked as over-medium. Additionally, I had to repeatedly ask for coffee refills, and the waitress appeared indifferent to the deficiencies in the service. To make matters worse, it took over 10 minutes to receive the check, giving me ample time to write and post this review. At a price of $40 for a simple breakfast for two, this experience was certainly not worth it.",
    "I frequent Sukho Thai and I find the negative ratings unjustified. While it may not be the most authentic Thai place, the food and service are consistently good. Their red and green curry are excellent, and I appreciate how the owner personally attends to the tables. The location next to a go-cart track adds a quirky touch. My only complaint is the absence of my favorite dish, Kee Mao, which I usually go elsewhere for.",
    "Muriel's offers a delightful dining experience with its stunning views, haunted history, and delicious food. Make sure to explore the 2nd level for a tour of the lounge area and enjoy a fantastic view of Jackson Square from the wrap-around balcony. The indoor patio dining area is my personal favorite for its tranquil setting. The dinner pre-fix menu is a great value, with the seafood gumbo and dijon mustard encrusted salmon being standout dishes. The wood grilled pork chop for lunch was flavorful and tender, although the accompanying red beans and rice were a bit bland. Overall, Muriel's is a must-visit for its ambiance and quality cuisine.",
    "Had an amazing lunch of fried green tomatoes and vegan barq. Excellent food, great beer selection, and a fantastic vibe. Super friendly and attentive staff, with enjoyable tunes playing in the background. Will definitely be returning!",
    "This Walmart in Meadowlark is conveniently located near my doctor's office. It's smaller than the supercentre but offers a decent selection of affordable items in the food section, although the produce section can be limited. Snacks and canned food are reasonably priced. Other sections and items can be hit or miss, like the limited selection of lightbulbs and lack of helpful associates. However, the checkout lines are usually short, which is a plus.",
    "This yoga place has significantly higher costs compared to others without reasonable justification. The two-for-one session deal, seemingly generous, is quite limited as it must be used within 14 days. Inconveniently, the location is quite far from the busy highway."
